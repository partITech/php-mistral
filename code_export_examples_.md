# Dijon Mayonnaise Ingredients

A typical Dijon mayonnaise consists of:

- Regular mayonnaise (which contains eggs, oil, vinegar or lemon juice)
- Dijon mustard
- Sometimes a small amount of garlic
- Occasionally herbs like tarragon or dill
- Salt and pepper to taste

The Dijon mustard gives the mayonnaise a tangy, slightly spicy flavor that distinguishes it from regular mayonnaise. The ratio of mayonnaise to Dijon mustard typically ranges from 4:1 to 8:1, depending on how strong you want the mustard flavor to be.

The image presents a statistical comparison highlighting France's social divide between disadvantaged areas and the country as a whole.

Key findings from the chart include:

- Working class representation: 33.5% in disadvantaged areas versus 14.5% nationally
- Unemployment: 18.1% in disadvantaged areas compared to 7.3% nationally
- Youth disengagement: 25.2% of 16-25 year-olds in disadvantaged areas are neither in school nor employed, versus 12.9% nationally
- Median monthly income: €1,168 in disadvantaged areas versus €1,822 nationally
- Poverty rate: 43.3% in disadvantaged areas compared to 15.5% nationally
- Overcrowded housing: 22.0% of households in disadvantaged areas versus 8.7% nationally

The chart defines disadvantaged areas as those with average per-capita income below €11,250/year, noting that in 2022, 5.4 million people (8% of France's population) lived in 1,514 such areas across 859 municipalities.

This visualization effectively demonstrates the significant socioeconomic disparities that exist within France, with disadvantaged areas facing substantially higher rates of poverty, unemployment, and housing challenges compared to national averages.

Melanie Ballard (Natasha Henstridge) arrives by train to a Mars mining camp which has cut all communication links with the company headquarters. She's not alone, as she is with a group of fellow police officers. They find the mining camp deserted except for a person in the prison, Desolation Williams (Ice Cube), who seems to laugh about them because they are all going to die. They were supposed to take Desolation to headquarters, but decide to explore first to find out what happened.They find a man inside an encapsulated mining car, who tells them not to open it. However, they do and he tries to kill them. One of the cops witnesses strange men with deep scarred and heavily tattooed faces killing the remaining survivors. The cops realise they need to leave the place fast.Desolation explains that the miners opened a kind of Martian construction in the soil which unleashed red dust. Those who breathed that dust became violent psychopaths who started to build weapons and kill the uninfected. They changed genetically, becoming distorted but much stronger.The cops and Desolation leave the prison with difficulty, and devise a plan to kill all the genetically modified ex-miners on the way out. However, the plan goes awry, and only Melanie and Desolation reach headquarters alive. Melanie realises that her bosses won't ever believe her. However, the red dust eventually arrives to headquarters, and Melanie and Desolation need to fight once again.

They find the mining camp deserted except for a person in the prison, Desolation Williams (Ice Cube), who seems to laugh about them because they are all going to die. They were supposed to take Desolation to headquarters, but decide to explore first to find out what happened.They find a man inside an encapsulated mining car, who tells them not to open it. However, they do and he tries to kill them. One of the cops witnesses strange men with deep scarred and heavily tattooed faces killing the remaining survivors. The cops realise they need to leave the place fast.Desolation explains that the miners opened a kind of Martian construction in the soil which unleashed red dust. Those who breathed that dust became violent psychopaths who started to build weapons and kill the uninfected. They changed genetically, becoming distorted but much stronger.The cops and Desolation leave the prison with difficulty, and devise a plan to kill all the genetically modified ex-miners on the way out. However, the plan goes awry, and only Melanie and Desolation reach headquarters alive. Melanie realises that her bosses won't ever believe her. However, the red dust eventually arrives to headquarters, and Melanie and Desolation need to fight once again.

A shy and demure 17-year-old teenage girl named Noriko Shimabara (Kazue Fukiishi) lives with her quiet family, formed by her sister Yuka (Yuriko Yoshitaka), her mother Taeko (Sanae Miyata), and her father Tetsuzo (Ken Mitsuishi), in Toyokawa, Japan. Noriko finds her small-town life unsatisfying and craves to move to Tokyo, assuming she would live a more active life there. This sentiment is especially encouraged when she finds that her elementary school friend Tangerine (Yoko Mitsuya) is now working independently as an idol. Noriko's father is strictly against her going to the city, and plans on having her join a local university after school.
Feeling alienated and misunderstood by her parents, Noriko resorts to the internet where she finds Haikyo.com, a website where other teenagers from Japan gather. There, after making new and unknown friends, she feels truly at "home" and eventually, on December 10, 2001, runs away from her unhappy life to Tokyo, where she plans on meeting the website's leader, a mysterious girl who uses the screen name "Ueno Station 54". Once in Tokyo, Noriko logs onto the website and contacts Ueno54. They meet up at Locker #54 in Ueno Train Station, where it is revealed that she is a young woman named Kumiko. She introduces Noriko to her family and takes Noriko to visit her grandparents. As it turns out, however, Kumiko has no real family, and the people she introduced Noriko to are paid actors working for Kumiko's organisation, I.C. Corp. The organisation offers paid roleplay services to interested clients, allowing them to fulfil their fantasies of a happy family life.
Six months later, 54 girls jump in front of a train at Shinjuku station and committ suicide while Noriko and Kumiko look on. It is implied that the 54 were members of the organization acting out their roles. Back in Toyokawa, Yuka, who was also a member of Haikyo.com, wonders if her sister was involved in the mass suicide. She writes a story speculating how her father would react if she were to disappear as well, and deliberately leaves clues before running off to Tokyo to join I.C. Corp.
Tetsuzo attempts to put on a brave face after Yuka's disappearance, but his wife Taeko's mental condition deteriorates rapidly and she eventually commits suicide. Meanwhile, Tetsuzo, a reporter, gathers clues regarding his daughters' disappearances and discovers Yuka's story. He is crushed to find that his daughter could predict his actions and behaviour so accurately while he was completely aloof of his daughters' feelings. His investigations reveal Haikyo.com and taking a cue from sensationalist media tabloids, he concludes that his daughters are part of a cult called the "Suicide Club".
Tetsuzo contacts a member of I.C. Corp, who refutes the existence of a "suicide club" and instead expounds on a concept of social roles that forms the basis of his organisation. Tetsuzo gets an old friend of his, Ikeda (Shirou Namiki) to pose as a client for I.C. Corp and rent Kumiko as his wife, and Noriko and Yuka as his daughters (who go by the aliases Mitsuko and Yoko respectively). Tetsuzo finds a house in Tokyo resembling his own and moves all the furniture from the old house to the new one, to resemble it exactly. Mitsuko and Yoko are unsettled when they arrive at the house, but fall back into their roles when prompted by Kumiko. Ikeda sends Kumiko away on an errand and Tetsuzo reveals himself. The girls, however, treat him as a stranger and insist that they are Mitsuko and Yoko, not Noriko and Yuka.
As the session falls apart, thugs from the organisation arrive on site to beat up Tetsuzo, who attacks them with a knife and kills all of them in the living room. Kumiko arrives from her errand shortly thereafter playing out her role as if nothing is wrong, but then implores Tetsuzo to kill her and run away with Noriko and Yuka. Her insistence gravely disturbs Noriko and Yuka, before Yuka interrupts the heated conversation and asks to 'extend the session'.
Finally, Tetsuzo, Kumiko, Mitsuko and Yuka dine together as a happy family and Tetsuzo begins acting as if Kumiko is his wife, calling her Taeko. Yuka does not sleep that night and at the leaves the home at crack of dawn, shedding her roles and names. Mitsuko awakens shortly thereafter and to herself, bids goodbye to Yuka, adolescence, Haikyo.com and Mitsuko, before finally declaring that she is Noriko.
By the end, two years have passed in this film and 18 months since Suicide Club.

                            [plot] => The film is divided into 5 chapters, the first four of which are named after characters in the film: Noriko, Yuka, Kumiko and Tetsuzo, in that order. The plot is told non-linearly and shifts between the perspectives of Noriko, Yuka and Tetsuzo.
A shy and demure 17-year-old teenage girl named Noriko Shimabara (Kazue Fukiishi) lives with her quiet family, formed by her sister Yuka (Yuriko Yoshitaka), her mother Taeko (Sanae Miyata), and her father Tetsuzo (Ken Mitsuishi), in Toyokawa, Japan. Noriko finds her small-town life unsatisfying and craves to move to Tokyo, assuming she would live a more active life there. This sentiment is especially encouraged when she finds that her elementary school friend Tangerine (Yoko Mitsuya) is now working independently as an idol. Noriko's father is strictly against her going to the city, and plans on having her join a local university after school.
Feeling alienated and misunderstood by her parents, Noriko resorts to the internet where she finds Haikyo.com, a website where other teenagers from Japan gather. There, after making new and unknown friends, she feels truly at "home" and eventually, on December 10, 2001, runs away from her unhappy life to Tokyo, where she plans on meeting the website's leader, a mysterious girl who uses the screen name "Ueno Station 54". Once in Tokyo, Noriko logs onto the website and contacts Ueno54. They meet up at Locker #54 in Ueno Train Station, where it is revealed that she is a young woman named Kumiko. She introduces Noriko to her family and takes Noriko to visit her grandparents. As it turns out, however, Kumiko has no real family, and the people she introduced Noriko to are paid actors working for Kumiko's organisation, I.C. Corp. The organisation offers paid roleplay services to interested clients, allowing them to fulfil their fantasies of a happy family life.
Six months later, 54 girls jump in front of a train at Shinjuku station and committ suicide while Noriko and Kumiko look on. It is implied that the 54 were members of the organization acting out their roles. Back in Toyokawa, Yuka, who was also a member of Haikyo.com, wonders if her sister was involved in the mass suicide. She writes a story speculating how her father would react if she were to disappear as well, and deliberately leaves clues before running off to Tokyo to join I.C. Corp.
Tetsuzo attempts to put on a brave face after Yuka's disappearance, but his wife Taeko's mental condition deteriorates rapidly and she eventually commits suicide. Meanwhile, Tetsuzo, a reporter, gathers clues regarding his daughters' disappearances and discovers Yuka's story. He is crushed to find that his daughter could predict his actions and behaviour so accurately while he was completely aloof of his daughters' feelings. His investigations reveal Haikyo.com and taking a cue from sensationalist media tabloids, he concludes that his daughters are part of a cult called the "Suicide Club".
Tetsuzo contacts a member of I.C. Corp, who refutes the existence of a "suicide club" and instead expounds on a concept of social roles that forms the basis of his organisation. Tetsuzo gets an old friend of his, Ikeda (Shirou Namiki) to pose as a client for I.C. Corp and rent Kumiko as his wife, and Noriko and Yuka as his daughters (who go by the aliases Mitsuko and Yoko respectively). Tetsuzo finds a house in Tokyo resembling his own and moves all the furniture from the old house to the new one, to resemble it exactly. Mitsuko and Yoko are unsettled when they arrive at the house, but fall back into their roles when prompted by Kumiko. Ikeda sends Kumiko away on an errand and Tetsuzo reveals himself. The girls, however, treat him as a stranger and insist that they are Mitsuko and Yoko, not Noriko and Yuka.
As the session falls apart, thugs from the organisation arrive on site to beat up Tetsuzo, who attacks them with a knife and kills all of them in the living room. Kumiko arrives from her errand shortly thereafter playing out her role as if nothing is wrong, but then implores Tetsuzo to kill her and run away with Noriko and Yuka. Her insistence gravely disturbs Noriko and Yuka, before Yuka interrupts the heated conversation and asks to 'extend the session'.
Finally, Tetsuzo, Kumiko, Mitsuko and Yuka dine together as a happy family and Tetsuzo begins acting as if Kumiko is his wife, calling her Taeko. Yuka does not sleep that night and at the leaves the home at crack of dawn, shedding her roles and names. Mitsuko awakens shortly thereafter and to herself, bids goodbye to Yuka, adolescence, Haikyo.com and Mitsuko, before finally declaring that she is Noriko.

                            [plot] => The film is divided into 5 chapters, the first four of which are named after characters in the film: Noriko, Yuka, Kumiko and Tetsuzo, in that order. The plot is told non-linearly and shifts between the perspectives of Noriko, Yuka and Tetsuzo.
A shy and demure 17-year-old teenage girl named Noriko Shimabara (Kazue Fukiishi) lives with her quiet family, formed by her sister Yuka (Yuriko Yoshitaka), her mother Taeko (Sanae Miyata), and her father Tetsuzo (Ken Mitsuishi), in Toyokawa, Japan. Noriko finds her small-town life unsatisfying and craves to move to Tokyo, assuming she would live a more active life there. This sentiment is especially encouraged when she finds that her elementary school friend Tangerine (Yoko Mitsuya) is now working independently as an idol. Noriko's father is strictly against her going to the city, and plans on having her join a local university after school.
Feeling alienated and misunderstood by her parents, Noriko resorts to the internet where she finds Haikyo.com, a website where other teenagers from Japan gather. There, after making new and unknown friends, she feels truly at "home" and eventually, on December 10, 2001, runs away from her unhappy life to Tokyo, where she plans on meeting the website's leader, a mysterious girl who uses the screen name "Ueno Station 54". Once in Tokyo, Noriko logs onto the website and contacts Ueno54. They meet up at Locker #54 in Ueno Train Station, where it is revealed that she is a young woman named Kumiko. She introduces Noriko to her family and takes Noriko to visit her grandparents. As it turns out, however, Kumiko has no real family, and the people she introduced Noriko to are paid actors working for Kumiko's organisation, I.C. Corp. The organisation offers paid roleplay services to interested clients, allowing them to fulfil their fantasies of a happy family life.
Six months later, 54 girls jump in front of a train at Shinjuku station and committ suicide while Noriko and Kumiko look on. It is implied that the 54 were members of the organization acting out their roles. Back in Toyokawa, Yuka, who was also a member of Haikyo.com, wonders if her sister was involved in the mass suicide. She writes a story speculating how her father would react if she were to disappear as well, and deliberately leaves clues before running off to Tokyo to join I.C. Corp.
Tetsuzo attempts to put on a brave face after Yuka's disappearance, but his wife Taeko's mental condition deteriorates rapidly and she eventually commits suicide. Meanwhile, Tetsuzo, a reporter, gathers clues regarding his daughters' disappearances and discovers Yuka's story. He is crushed to find that his daughter could predict his actions and behaviour so accurately while he was completely aloof of his daughters' feelings. His investigations reveal Haikyo.com and taking a cue from sensationalist media tabloids, he concludes that his daughters are part of a cult called the "Suicide Club".
Tetsuzo contacts a member of I.C. Corp, who refutes the existence of a "suicide club" and instead expounds on a concept of social roles that forms the basis of his organisation. Tetsuzo gets an old friend of his, Ikeda (Shirou Namiki) to pose as a client for I.C. Corp and rent Kumiko as his wife, and Noriko and Yuka as his daughters (who go by the aliases Mitsuko and Yoko respectively). Tetsuzo finds a house in Tokyo resembling his own and moves all the furniture from the old house to the new one, to resemble it exactly. Mitsuko and Yoko are unsettled when they arrive at the house, but fall back into their roles when prompted by Kumiko. Ikeda sends Kumiko away on an errand and Tetsuzo reveals himself. The girls, however, treat him as a stranger and insist that they are Mitsuko and Yoko, not Noriko and Yuka.
As the session falls apart, thugs from the organisation arrive on site to beat up Tetsuzo, who attacks them with a knife and kills all of them in the living room. Kumiko arrives from her errand shortly thereafter playing out her role as if nothing is wrong, but then implores Tetsuzo to kill her and run away with Noriko and Yuka. Her insistence gravely disturbs Noriko and Yuka, before Yuka interrupts the heated conversation and asks to 'extend the session'.
Finally, Tetsuzo, Kumiko, Mitsuko and Yuka dine together as a happy family and Tetsuzo begins acting as if Kumiko is his wife, calling her Taeko. Yuka does not sleep that night and at the leaves the home at crack of dawn, shedding her roles and names. Mitsuko awakens shortly thereafter and to herself, bids goodbye to Yuka, adolescence, Haikyo.com and Mitsuko, before finally declaring that she is Noriko.
By the end, two years have passed in this film and 18 months since Suicide Club.

Tetsuzo contacts a member of I.C. Corp, who refutes the existence of a "suicide club" and instead expounds on a concept of social roles that forms the basis of his organisation. Tetsuzo gets an old friend of his, Ikeda (Shirou Namiki) to pose as a client for I.C. Corp and rent Kumiko as his wife, and Noriko and Yuka as his daughters (who go by the aliases Mitsuko and Yoko respectively). Tetsuzo finds a house in Tokyo resembling his own and moves all the furniture from the old house to the new one, to resemble it exactly. Mitsuko and Yoko are unsettled when they arrive at the house, but fall back into their roles when prompted by Kumiko. Ikeda sends Kumiko away on an errand and Tetsuzo reveals himself. The girls, however, treat him as a stranger and insist that they are Mitsuko and Yoko, not Noriko and Yuka.
As the session falls apart, thugs from the organisation arrive on site to beat up Tetsuzo, who attacks them with a knife and kills all of them in the living room. Kumiko arrives from her errand shortly thereafter playing out her role as if nothing is wrong, but then implores Tetsuzo to kill her and run away with Noriko and Yuka. Her insistence gravely disturbs Noriko and Yuka, before Yuka interrupts the heated conversation and asks to 'extend the session'.
Finally, Tetsuzo, Kumiko, Mitsuko and Yuka dine together as a happy family and Tetsuzo begins acting as if Kumiko is his wife, calling her Taeko. Yuka does not sleep that night and at the leaves the home at crack of dawn, shedding her roles and names. Mitsuko awakens shortly thereafter and to herself, bids goodbye to Yuka, adolescence, Haikyo.com and Mitsuko, before finally declaring that she is Noriko.
By the end, two years have passed in this film and 18 months since Suicide Club.

                            [plot] => The film is divided into 5 chapters, the first four of which are named after characters in the film: Noriko, Yuka, Kumiko and Tetsuzo, in that order. The plot is told non-linearly and shifts between the perspectives of Noriko, Yuka and Tetsuzo.
A shy and demure 17-year-old teenage girl named Noriko Shimabara (Kazue Fukiishi) lives with her quiet family, formed by her sister Yuka (Yuriko Yoshitaka), her mother Taeko (Sanae Miyata), and her father Tetsuzo (Ken Mitsuishi), in Toyokawa, Japan. Noriko finds her small-town life unsatisfying and craves to move to Tokyo, assuming she would live a more active life there. This sentiment is especially encouraged when she finds that her elementary school friend Tangerine (Yoko Mitsuya) is now working independently as an idol. Noriko's father is strictly against her going to the city, and plans on having her join a local university after school.
Feeling alienated and misunderstood by her parents, Noriko resorts to the internet where she finds Haikyo.com, a website where other teenagers from Japan gather. There, after making new and unknown friends, she feels truly at "home" and eventually, on December 10, 2001, runs away from her unhappy life to Tokyo, where she plans on meeting the website's leader, a mysterious girl who uses the screen name "Ueno Station 54". Once in Tokyo, Noriko logs onto the website and contacts Ueno54. They meet up at Locker #54 in Ueno Train Station, where it is revealed that she is a young woman named Kumiko. She introduces Noriko to her family and takes Noriko to visit her grandparents. As it turns out, however, Kumiko has no real family, and the people she introduced Noriko to are paid actors working for Kumiko's organisation, I.C. Corp. The organisation offers paid roleplay services to interested clients, allowing them to fulfil their fantasies of a happy family life.
Six months later, 54 girls jump in front of a train at Shinjuku station and committ suicide while Noriko and Kumiko look on. It is implied that the 54 were members of the organization acting out their roles. Back in Toyokawa, Yuka, who was also a member of Haikyo.com, wonders if her sister was involved in the mass suicide. She writes a story speculating how her father would react if she were to disappear as well, and deliberately leaves clues before running off to Tokyo to join I.C. Corp.
Tetsuzo attempts to put on a brave face after Yuka's disappearance, but his wife Taeko's mental condition deteriorates rapidly and she eventually commits suicide. Meanwhile, Tetsuzo, a reporter, gathers clues regarding his daughters' disappearances and discovers Yuka's story. He is crushed to find that his daughter could predict his actions and behaviour so accurately while he was completely aloof of his daughters' feelings. His investigations reveal Haikyo.com and taking a cue from sensationalist media tabloids, he concludes that his daughters are part of a cult called the "Suicide Club".

A shy and demure 17-year-old teenage girl named Noriko Shimabara (Kazue Fukiishi) lives with her quiet family, formed by her sister Yuka (Yuriko Yoshitaka), her mother Taeko (Sanae Miyata), and her father Tetsuzo (Ken Mitsuishi), in Toyokawa, Japan. Noriko finds her small-town life unsatisfying and craves to move to Tokyo, assuming she would live a more active life there. This sentiment is especially encouraged when she finds that her elementary school friend Tangerine (Yoko Mitsuya) is now working independently as an idol. Noriko's father is strictly against her going to the city, and plans on having her join a local university after school.
Feeling alienated and misunderstood by her parents, Noriko resorts to the internet where she finds Haikyo.com, a website where other teenagers from Japan gather. There, after making new and unknown friends, she feels truly at "home" and eventually, on December 10, 2001, runs away from her unhappy life to Tokyo, where she plans on meeting the website's leader, a mysterious girl who uses the screen name "Ueno Station 54". Once in Tokyo, Noriko logs onto the website and contacts Ueno54. They meet up at Locker #54 in Ueno Train Station, where it is revealed that she is a young woman named Kumiko. She introduces Noriko to her family and takes Noriko to visit her grandparents. As it turns out, however, Kumiko has no real family, and the people she introduced Noriko to are paid actors working for Kumiko's organisation, I.C. Corp. The organisation offers paid roleplay services to interested clients, allowing them to fulfil their fantasies of a happy family life.
Six months later, 54 girls jump in front of a train at Shinjuku station and committ suicide while Noriko and Kumiko look on. It is implied that the 54 were members of the organization acting out their roles. Back in Toyokawa, Yuka, who was also a member of Haikyo.com, wonders if her sister was involved in the mass suicide. She writes a story speculating how her father would react if she were to disappear as well, and deliberately leaves clues before running off to Tokyo to join I.C. Corp.
Tetsuzo attempts to put on a brave face after Yuka's disappearance, but his wife Taeko's mental condition deteriorates rapidly and she eventually commits suicide. Meanwhile, Tetsuzo, a reporter, gathers clues regarding his daughters' disappearances and discovers Yuka's story. He is crushed to find that his daughter could predict his actions and behaviour so accurately while he was completely aloof of his daughters' feelings. His investigations reveal Haikyo.com and taking a cue from sensationalist media tabloids, he concludes that his daughters are part of a cult called the "Suicide Club".
Tetsuzo contacts a member of I.C. Corp, who refutes the existence of a "suicide club" and instead expounds on a concept of social roles that forms the basis of his organisation. Tetsuzo gets an old friend of his, Ikeda (Shirou Namiki) to pose as a client for I.C. Corp and rent Kumiko as his wife, and Noriko and Yuka as his daughters (who go by the aliases Mitsuko and Yoko respectively). Tetsuzo finds a house in Tokyo resembling his own and moves all the furniture from the old house to the new one, to resemble it exactly. Mitsuko and Yoko are unsettled when they arrive at the house, but fall back into their roles when prompted by Kumiko. Ikeda sends Kumiko away on an errand and Tetsuzo reveals himself. The girls, however, treat him as a stranger and insist that they are Mitsuko and Yoko, not Noriko and Yuka.
As the session falls apart, thugs from the organisation arrive on site to beat up Tetsuzo, who attacks them with a knife and kills all of them in the living room. Kumiko arrives from her errand shortly thereafter playing out her role as if nothing is wrong, but then implores Tetsuzo to kill her and run away with Noriko and Yuka. Her insistence gravely disturbs Noriko and Yuka, before Yuka interrupts the heated conversation and asks to 'extend the session'.
Finally, Tetsuzo, Kumiko, Mitsuko and Yuka dine together as a happy family and Tetsuzo begins acting as if Kumiko is his wife, calling her Taeko. Yuka does not sleep that night and at the leaves the home at crack of dawn, shedding her roles and names. Mitsuko awakens shortly thereafter and to herself, bids goodbye to Yuka, adolescence, Haikyo.com and Mitsuko, before finally declaring that she is Noriko.
By the end, two years have passed in this film and 18 months since Suicide Club.

On January 1, 2008 at the Xcalibur Bowling Centre, a disco-themed bowling alley in Surrey, British Columbia, Egerton, the janitor, has allowed two groups of teenagers to bowl against one another after hours. The "prep", Steve, is still bitter after his best friend Jamie, the "jock", had sex with Lisa, a girl with whom Steve was smitten and even took to their senior prom. After Steve and his friends Joey, Patrick, and A.J. harass the "tranny", Sam, they are chastised by Jamie. This leads to a brawl between Steve's team and Jamie's. Lisa breaks up the fight by dropping a bowling ball on Steve's foot just as Steve is about to kick Jamie again. Egerton, brandishing a shotgun, tells the teenagers to leave and they can continue their tournament the following night.
Lisa, having forgot her purse in the arcade, returns to find Steve and his friends waiting for her. Steve proceeds to violently rape Lisa while the others watch. Egerton is oblivious to Lisa's cries for help, as he is downstairs cleaning up the mess the teenagers made. After he is finished raping Lisa, Steve leaves the room. While Steve is gone, A.J. anally rapes Lisa on the pool table; then it's Joey who abuses her. Patrick, who believed the three were only going to "scare" Lisa, refuses to participate in the rape. Steve returns with a bowling pin and prepares to insert it into Lisa before Patrick intervenes. Steve retorts by giving Patrick the pin and ordering him to do it himself. Patrick refuses to do so at first but complies when Steve threatens to do the same to him. In the end Patrick penetrates Lisa with the bowling pin as she screams in pain. The four leave Lisa on the pool table, naked and barely conscious.
The following night, the two groups arrive at the bowling alley to continue their tournament. Steve is joined by his "girlfriends", Julia and Hannah. Jamie arrives late with Lisa, who barely speaks. As the teams begin their first game of the night, Lisa suddenly gets on an elevator. She is confronted by Patrick, who says he's only at the bowling alley to apologize. Lisa doesn't believe him, and insists that he is only there to make sure that she hasn't contacted the police. During the game, the players notice a mystery player on the scoreboard, BBK, but believe it is just a glitch. Dave, one of Jamie's friends, meets Julia in the bar and pays for two beers she ordered. When he discovers that one of them belongs to Steve, he asks if he can urinate in it. Julia tells him that she doesn't care and that she dislikes Steve too but hangs out with him anyway because he's dating her friend Hannah. Julia follows Dave into the bathroom and the two begin to make out. A mysterious person wearing bowling attire exits one of the stalls while Dave and Julia are in the 69 position and forces Julia's head further onto Dave's penis while forcing Dave's head further between Julia's legs, suffocating them both. After they are dead, two strikes appear next to BBK on the scoreboard in the form of a skull and crossbones.
The game continues and Sam goes to the bathroom so she can "freshen up". The person who murdered Dave and Julia is hiding in one of the stalls when Sam enters the girls' restroom and Sam, frightened by the noise coming from the stall, approaches it and is pulled inside. She tries to bargain with the killer, but the killer murders her by forcing a bowling pin down her throat. The killer lifts Sam's skirt up and, using the switchblade Sam tried to defend herself with, castrates Sam lengthwise. Later, Ben and Cindy leave to have sex in a storage room upstairs, but Ben leaves Cindy alone to buy a condom from the vending machine in the bathroom. He dies when the killer hits him over the head with a bowling pin and gouges his eyes out with a sharpened one. The killer finds Cindy upstairs and strangles her to death with a pair of bowling sneakers. Downstairs, Hannah searches for Julia but dies when the killer crushes her head with two bowling balls. Joey goes back behind the pin setters to fix his team's after noticing they were broken. A.J. notices the strikes appearing next to BBK on the scoreboard and questions Egerton about it, who assures him that it is still a glitch. Egerton sends A.J. to an area currently being remodeled with an "out of order" sign to put on an automatic ball polisher that Joey broke earlier. A.J. turns the ball polisher on and finds it already fixed but gets killed when the killer uses it to wax his face off.
Steve, noticing that something is amiss, leaves to find Joey behind the pin setters. Joey lies dead on the ground, headless. Steve is frightened by the killer, who bludgeons him with a bowling pin before sodomizing him with another sharpened pin. As Steve tries to crawl away, the killer smashes his head in with the bowling pin. Meanwhile, Sarah and Jamie continue their game. Jamie reaches into the ball return slot to find his bowling ball, instead discovering Joey's severed head. The two try desperately to escape the bowling alley before coming face to face with the killer. They run and hide in the basement, where they find their friends' bodies. The killer appears with a shotgun and removes the bowling bag to reveal Egerton's face. Sarah discovers that Jamie knew about the murders of Steve, Joey, and A.J. but not the others. Lisa appears, dressed up as well, revealing that she murdered Steve. Jamie explains that Lisa told her father, who turns out to be Egerton, about the rape and Egerton let Jamie in on the plan. When asked why he killed their friends too, Egerton explains that they didn't intervene when Lisa reentered the bowling alley and are therefore just as guilty. Another person dressed like the killer, as Egerton goes on to explain, Another killer (possibly the real "BBK") enters the basement and removes the bowling bag to reveal Patrick's face. Patrick explains that he confessed his involvement to Egerton and wanted to contact the police, but Egerton let him in on the plan instead and he was the person who murdered Joey and A.J., supposedly to make it up to her. Lisa is furious that her father allowed him to live so Egerton betrays Patrick and slits his throat with the switchblade he got from Sam. Jamie, realizing he's out of control, wrestles Egerton to the ground and, after a scuffle, blows his head clean off with the shotgun. Lisa cradles her father's body before grabbing the switchblade and trying to attack Jamie. Sarah grabs the shotgun and kills Lisa.
With the three "BBK"'s dead, Sarah shoots the locks off of the emergency doors and the two survivors escape the bowling alley. Traumatized and, above all, upset that Jamie did nothing to prevent the murders, Sarah turns the gun on him, pumps it saying: "'cuz we're both fucked". The screen cuts to black as a gunshot is heard, indicating that Sarah murdered Jamie and is on the run.

On January 1, 2008 at the Xcalibur Bowling Centre, a disco-themed bowling alley in Surrey, British Columbia, Egerton, the janitor, has allowed two groups of teenagers to bowl against one another after hours. The "prep", Steve, is still bitter after his best friend Jamie, the "jock", had sex with Lisa, a girl with whom Steve was smitten and even took to their senior prom. After Steve and his friends Joey, Patrick, and A.J. harass the "tranny", Sam, they are chastised by Jamie. This leads to a brawl between Steve's team and Jamie's. Lisa breaks up the fight by dropping a bowling ball on Steve's foot just as Steve is about to kick Jamie again. Egerton, brandishing a shotgun, tells the teenagers to leave and they can continue their tournament the following night.
Lisa, having forgot her purse in the arcade, returns to find Steve and his friends waiting for her. Steve proceeds to violently rape Lisa while the others watch. Egerton is oblivious to Lisa's cries for help, as he is downstairs cleaning up the mess the teenagers made. After he is finished raping Lisa, Steve leaves the room. While Steve is gone, A.J. anally rapes Lisa on the pool table; then it's Joey who abuses her. Patrick, who believed the three were only going to "scare" Lisa, refuses to participate in the rape. Steve returns with a bowling pin and prepares to insert it into Lisa before Patrick intervenes. Steve retorts by giving Patrick the pin and ordering him to do it himself. Patrick refuses to do so at first but complies when Steve threatens to do the same to him. In the end Patrick penetrates Lisa with the bowling pin as she screams in pain. The four leave Lisa on the pool table, naked and barely conscious.
The following night, the two groups arrive at the bowling alley to continue their tournament. Steve is joined by his "girlfriends", Julia and Hannah. Jamie arrives late with Lisa, who barely speaks. As the teams begin their first game of the night, Lisa suddenly gets on an elevator. She is confronted by Patrick, who says he's only at the bowling alley to apologize. Lisa doesn't believe him, and insists that he is only there to make sure that she hasn't contacted the police. During the game, the players notice a mystery player on the scoreboard, BBK, but believe it is just a glitch. Dave, one of Jamie's friends, meets Julia in the bar and pays for two beers she ordered. When he discovers that one of them belongs to Steve, he asks if he can urinate in it. Julia tells him that she doesn't care and that she dislikes Steve too but hangs out with him anyway because he's dating her friend Hannah. Julia follows Dave into the bathroom and the two begin to make out. A mysterious person wearing bowling attire exits one of the stalls while Dave and Julia are in the 69 position and forces Julia's head further onto Dave's penis while forcing Dave's head further between Julia's legs, suffocating them both. After they are dead, two strikes appear next to BBK on the scoreboard in the form of a skull and crossbones.
The game continues and Sam goes to the bathroom so she can "freshen up". The person who murdered Dave and Julia is hiding in one of the stalls when Sam enters the girls' restroom and Sam, frightened by the noise coming from the stall, approaches it and is pulled inside. She tries to bargain with the killer, but the killer murders her by forcing a bowling pin down her throat. The killer lifts Sam's skirt up and, using the switchblade Sam tried to defend herself with, castrates Sam lengthwise. Later, Ben and Cindy leave to have sex in a storage room upstairs, but Ben leaves Cindy alone to buy a condom from the vending machine in the bathroom. He dies when the killer hits him over the head with a bowling pin and gouges his eyes out with a sharpened one. The killer finds Cindy upstairs and strangles her to death with a pair of bowling sneakers. Downstairs, Hannah searches for Julia but dies when the killer crushes her head with two bowling balls. Joey goes back behind the pin setters to fix his team's after noticing they were broken. A.J. notices the strikes appearing next to BBK on the scoreboard and questions Egerton about it, who assures him that it is still a glitch. Egerton sends A.J. to an area currently being remodeled with an "out of order" sign to put on an automatic ball polisher that Joey broke earlier. A.J. turns the ball polisher on and finds it already fixed but gets killed when the killer uses it to wax his face off.
Steve, noticing that something is amiss, leaves to find Joey behind the pin setters. Joey lies dead on the ground, headless. Steve is frightened by the killer, who bludgeons him with a bowling pin before sodomizing him with another sharpened pin. As Steve tries to crawl away, the killer smashes his head in with the bowling pin. Meanwhile, Sarah and Jamie continue their game. Jamie reaches into the ball return slot to find his bowling ball, instead discovering Joey's severed head. The two try desperately to escape the bowling alley before coming face to face with the killer. They run and hide in the basement, where they find their friends' bodies. The killer appears with a shotgun and removes the bowling bag to reveal Egerton's face. Sarah discovers that Jamie knew about the murders of Steve, Joey, and A.J. but not the others. Lisa appears, dressed up as well, revealing that she murdered Steve. Jamie explains that Lisa told her father, who turns out to be Egerton, about the rape and Egerton let Jamie in on the plan. When asked why he killed their friends too, Egerton explains that they didn't intervene when Lisa reentered the bowling alley and are therefore just as guilty. Another person dressed like the killer, as Egerton goes on to explain, Another killer (possibly the real "BBK") enters the basement and removes the bowling bag to reveal Patrick's face. Patrick explains that he confessed his involvement to Egerton and wanted to contact the police, but Egerton let him in on the plan instead and he was the person who murdered Joey and A.J., supposedly to make it up to her. Lisa is furious that her father allowed him to live so Egerton betrays Patrick and slits his throat with the switchblade he got from Sam. Jamie, realizing he's out of control, wrestles Egerton to the ground and, after a scuffle, blows his head clean off with the shotgun. Lisa cradles her father's body before grabbing the switchblade and trying to attack Jamie. Sarah grabs the shotgun and kills Lisa.
With the three "BBK"'s dead, Sarah shoots the locks off of the emergency doors and the two survivors escape the bowling alley. Traumatized and, above all, upset that Jamie did nothing to prevent the murders, Sarah turns the gun on him, pumps it saying: "'cuz we're both fucked". The screen cuts to black as a gunshot is heard, indicating that Sarah murdered Jamie and is on the run.

The two try desperately to escape the bowling alley before coming face to face with the killer. They run and hide in the basement, where they find their friends' bodies. The killer appears with a shotgun and removes the bowling bag to reveal Egerton's face. Sarah discovers that Jamie knew about the murders of Steve, Joey, and A.J. but not the others. Lisa appears, dressed up as well, revealing that she murdered Steve. Jamie explains that Lisa told her father, who turns out to be Egerton, about the rape and Egerton let Jamie in on the plan. When asked why he killed their friends too, Egerton explains that they didn't intervene when Lisa reentered the bowling alley and are therefore just as guilty. Another person dressed like the killer, as Egerton goes on to explain, Another killer (possibly the real "BBK") enters the basement and removes the bowling bag to reveal Patrick's face. Patrick explains that he confessed his involvement to Egerton and wanted to contact the police, but Egerton let him in on the plan instead and he was the person who murdered Joey and A.J., supposedly to make it up to her. Lisa is furious that her father allowed him to live so Egerton betrays Patrick and slits his throat with the switchblade he got from Sam. Jamie, realizing he's out of control, wrestles Egerton to the ground and, after a scuffle, blows his head clean off with the shotgun. Lisa cradles her father's body before grabbing the switchblade and trying to attack Jamie. Sarah grabs the shotgun and kills Lisa.
With the three "BBK"'s dead, Sarah shoots the locks off of the emergency doors and the two survivors escape the bowling alley. Traumatized and, above all, upset that Jamie did nothing to prevent the murders, Sarah turns the gun on him, pumps it saying: "'cuz we're both fucked". The screen cuts to black as a gunshot is heard, indicating that Sarah murdered Jamie and is on the run.

On January 1, 2008 at the Xcalibur Bowling Centre, a disco-themed bowling alley in Surrey, British Columbia, Egerton, the janitor, has allowed two groups of teenagers to bowl against one another after hours. The "prep", Steve, is still bitter after his best friend Jamie, the "jock", had sex with Lisa, a girl with whom Steve was smitten and even took to their senior prom. After Steve and his friends Joey, Patrick, and A.J. harass the "tranny", Sam, they are chastised by Jamie. This leads to a brawl between Steve's team and Jamie's. Lisa breaks up the fight by dropping a bowling ball on Steve's foot just as Steve is about to kick Jamie again. Egerton, brandishing a shotgun, tells the teenagers to leave and they can continue their tournament the following night.
Lisa, having forgot her purse in the arcade, returns to find Steve and his friends waiting for her. Steve proceeds to violently rape Lisa while the others watch. Egerton is oblivious to Lisa's cries for help, as he is downstairs cleaning up the mess the teenagers made. After he is finished raping Lisa, Steve leaves the room. While Steve is gone, A.J. anally rapes Lisa on the pool table; then it's Joey who abuses her. Patrick, who believed the three were only going to "scare" Lisa, refuses to participate in the rape. Steve returns with a bowling pin and prepares to insert it into Lisa before Patrick intervenes. Steve retorts by giving Patrick the pin and ordering him to do it himself. Patrick refuses to do so at first but complies when Steve threatens to do the same to him. In the end Patrick penetrates Lisa with the bowling pin as she screams in pain. The four leave Lisa on the pool table, naked and barely conscious.
The following night, the two groups arrive at the bowling alley to continue their tournament. Steve is joined by his "girlfriends", Julia and Hannah. Jamie arrives late with Lisa, who barely speaks. As the teams begin their first game of the night, Lisa suddenly gets on an elevator. She is confronted by Patrick, who says he's only at the bowling alley to apologize. Lisa doesn't believe him, and insists that he is only there to make sure that she hasn't contacted the police. During the game, the players notice a mystery player on the scoreboard, BBK, but believe it is just a glitch. Dave, one of Jamie's friends, meets Julia in the bar and pays for two beers she ordered. When he discovers that one of them belongs to Steve, he asks if he can urinate in it. Julia tells him that she doesn't care and that she dislikes Steve too but hangs out with him anyway because he's dating her friend Hannah. Julia follows Dave into the bathroom and the two begin to make out. A mysterious person wearing bowling attire exits one of the stalls while Dave and Julia are in the 69 position and forces Julia's head further onto Dave's penis while forcing Dave's head further between Julia's legs, suffocating them both. After they are dead, two strikes appear next to BBK on the scoreboard in the form of a skull and crossbones.
The game continues and Sam goes to the bathroom so she can "freshen up". The person who murdered Dave and Julia is hiding in one of the stalls when Sam enters the girls' restroom and Sam, frightened by the noise coming from the stall, approaches it and is pulled inside. She tries to bargain with the killer, but the killer murders her by forcing a bowling pin down her throat. The killer lifts Sam's skirt up and, using the switchblade Sam tried to defend herself with, castrates Sam lengthwise. Later, Ben and Cindy leave to have sex in a storage room upstairs, but Ben leaves Cindy alone to buy a condom from the vending machine in the bathroom. He dies when the killer hits him over the head with a bowling pin and gouges his eyes out with a sharpened one. The killer finds Cindy upstairs and strangles her to death with a pair of bowling sneakers. Downstairs, Hannah searches for Julia but dies when the killer crushes her head with two bowling balls. Joey goes back behind the pin setters to fix his team's after noticing they were broken. A.J. notices the strikes appearing next to BBK on the scoreboard and questions Egerton about it, who assures him that it is still a glitch. Egerton sends A.J. to an area currently being remodeled with an "out of order" sign to put on an automatic ball polisher that Joey broke earlier. A.J. turns the ball polisher on and finds it already fixed but gets killed when the killer uses it to wax his face off.
Steve, noticing that something is amiss, leaves to find Joey behind the pin setters. Joey lies dead on the ground, headless. Steve is frightened by the killer, who bludgeons him with a bowling pin before sodomizing him with another sharpened pin. As Steve tries to crawl away, the killer smashes his head in with the bowling pin. Meanwhile, Sarah and Jamie continue their game. Jamie reaches into the ball return slot to find his bowling ball, instead discovering Joey's severed head. The two try desperately to escape the bowling alley before coming face to face with the killer. They run and hide in the basement, where they find their friends' bodies.

Lisa breaks up the fight by dropping a bowling ball on Steve's foot just as Steve is about to kick Jamie again. Egerton, brandishing a shotgun, tells the teenagers to leave and they can continue their tournament the following night.
Lisa, having forgot her purse in the arcade, returns to find Steve and his friends waiting for her. Steve proceeds to violently rape Lisa while the others watch. Egerton is oblivious to Lisa's cries for help, as he is downstairs cleaning up the mess the teenagers made. After he is finished raping Lisa, Steve leaves the room. While Steve is gone, A.J. anally rapes Lisa on the pool table; then it's Joey who abuses her. Patrick, who believed the three were only going to "scare" Lisa, refuses to participate in the rape. Steve returns with a bowling pin and prepares to insert it into Lisa before Patrick intervenes. Steve retorts by giving Patrick the pin and ordering him to do it himself. Patrick refuses to do so at first but complies when Steve threatens to do the same to him. In the end Patrick penetrates Lisa with the bowling pin as she screams in pain. The four leave Lisa on the pool table, naked and barely conscious.
The following night, the two groups arrive at the bowling alley to continue their tournament. Steve is joined by his "girlfriends", Julia and Hannah. Jamie arrives late with Lisa, who barely speaks. As the teams begin their first game of the night, Lisa suddenly gets on an elevator. She is confronted by Patrick, who says he's only at the bowling alley to apologize. Lisa doesn't believe him, and insists that he is only there to make sure that she hasn't contacted the police. During the game, the players notice a mystery player on the scoreboard, BBK, but believe it is just a glitch. Dave, one of Jamie's friends, meets Julia in the bar and pays for two beers she ordered. When he discovers that one of them belongs to Steve, he asks if he can urinate in it. Julia tells him that she doesn't care and that she dislikes Steve too but hangs out with him anyway because he's dating her friend Hannah. Julia follows Dave into the bathroom and the two begin to make out. A mysterious person wearing bowling attire exits one of the stalls while Dave and Julia are in the 69 position and forces Julia's head further onto Dave's penis while forcing Dave's head further between Julia's legs, suffocating them both. After they are dead, two strikes appear next to BBK on the scoreboard in the form of a skull and crossbones.
The game continues and Sam goes to the bathroom so she can "freshen up". The person who murdered Dave and Julia is hiding in one of the stalls when Sam enters the girls' restroom and Sam, frightened by the noise coming from the stall, approaches it and is pulled inside. She tries to bargain with the killer, but the killer murders her by forcing a bowling pin down her throat. The killer lifts Sam's skirt up and, using the switchblade Sam tried to defend herself with, castrates Sam lengthwise. Later, Ben and Cindy leave to have sex in a storage room upstairs, but Ben leaves Cindy alone to buy a condom from the vending machine in the bathroom. He dies when the killer hits him over the head with a bowling pin and gouges his eyes out with a sharpened one. The killer finds Cindy upstairs and strangles her to death with a pair of bowling sneakers. Downstairs, Hannah searches for Julia but dies when the killer crushes her head with two bowling balls. Joey goes back behind the pin setters to fix his team's after noticing they were broken. A.J. notices the strikes appearing next to BBK on the scoreboard and questions Egerton about it, who assures him that it is still a glitch. Egerton sends A.J. to an area currently being remodeled with an "out of order" sign to put on an automatic ball polisher that Joey broke earlier. A.J. turns the ball polisher on and finds it already fixed but gets killed when the killer uses it to wax his face off.
Steve, noticing that something is amiss, leaves to find Joey behind the pin setters. Joey lies dead on the ground, headless. Steve is frightened by the killer, who bludgeons him with a bowling pin before sodomizing him with another sharpened pin. As Steve tries to crawl away, the killer smashes his head in with the bowling pin. Meanwhile, Sarah and Jamie continue their game. Jamie reaches into the ball return slot to find his bowling ball, instead discovering Joey's severed head. The two try desperately to escape the bowling alley before coming face to face with the killer. They run and hide in the basement, where they find their friends' bodies. The killer appears with a shotgun and removes the bowling bag to reveal Egerton's face. Sarah discovers that Jamie knew about the murders of Steve, Joey, and A.J. but not the others. Lisa appears, dressed up as well, revealing that she murdered Steve. Jamie explains that Lisa told her father, who turns out to be Egerton, about the rape and Egerton let Jamie in on the plan. When asked why he killed their friends too, Egerton explains that they didn't intervene when Lisa reentered the bowling alley and are therefore just as guilty. Another person dressed like the killer, as Egerton goes on to explain, Another killer (possibly the real "BBK") enters the basement and removes the bowling bag to reveal Patrick's face. Patrick explains that he confessed his involvement to Egerton and wanted to contact the police, but Egerton let him in on the plan instead and he was the person who murdered Joey and A.J., supposedly to make it up to her. Lisa is furious that her father allowed him to live so Egerton betrays Patrick and slits his throat with the switchblade he got from Sam. Jamie, realizing he's out of control, wrestles Egerton to the ground and, after a scuffle, blows his head clean off with the shotgun. Lisa cradles her father's body before grabbing the switchblade and trying to attack Jamie. Sarah grabs the shotgun and kills Lisa.
With the three "BBK"'s dead, Sarah shoots the locks off of the emergency doors and the two survivors escape the bowling alley. Traumatized and, above all, upset that Jamie did nothing to prevent the murders, Sarah turns the gun on him, pumps it saying: "'cuz we're both fucked". The screen cuts to black as a gunshot is heard, indicating that Sarah murdered Jamie and is on the run.

On January 1, 2008 at the Xcalibur Bowling Centre, a disco-themed bowling alley in Surrey, British Columbia, Egerton, the janitor, has allowed two groups of teenagers to bowl against one another after hours. The "prep", Steve, is still bitter after his best friend Jamie, the "jock", had sex with Lisa, a girl with whom Steve was smitten and even took to their senior prom. After Steve and his friends Joey, Patrick, and A.J. harass the "tranny", Sam, they are chastised by Jamie. This leads to a brawl between Steve's team and Jamie's. Lisa breaks up the fight by dropping a bowling ball on Steve's foot just as Steve is about to kick Jamie again. Egerton, brandishing a shotgun, tells the teenagers to leave and they can continue their tournament the following night.
Lisa, having forgot her purse in the arcade, returns to find Steve and his friends waiting for her. Steve proceeds to violently rape Lisa while the others watch. Egerton is oblivious to Lisa's cries for help, as he is downstairs cleaning up the mess the teenagers made. After he is finished raping Lisa, Steve leaves the room. While Steve is gone, A.J. anally rapes Lisa on the pool table; then it's Joey who abuses her. Patrick, who believed the three were only going to "scare" Lisa, refuses to participate in the rape. Steve returns with a bowling pin and prepares to insert it into Lisa before Patrick intervenes. Steve retorts by giving Patrick the pin and ordering him to do it himself. Patrick refuses to do so at first but complies when Steve threatens to do the same to him. In the end Patrick penetrates Lisa with the bowling pin as she screams in pain. The four leave Lisa on the pool table, naked and barely conscious.

The Little Elephant calls some string T of the length M balanced if there exists at least one integer X (1 ≤ X ≤ M) such that the number of digits 4 in the substring T[1, X - 1] is equal to the number of digits 7 in the substring T[X, M]. For example, the string S = 7477447 is balanced since S[1, 4] = 7477 has 1 digit 4 and S[5, 7] = 447 has 1 digit 7. On the other hand, one can verify that the string S = 7 is not balanced.
 The Little Elephant has the string S of the length N. He wants to know the number of such pairs of integers (L; R) that 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N and the substring S[L, R]  is balanced. Help him to find this number.
Notes.

Let S be some lucky string. Then


|S| denotes the length of the string S;

S[i] (1 ≤ i ≤ |S|) denotes the i^th character of S (the numeration of characters starts from 1);

 S[L, R] (1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ |S|) denotes the string with the following sequence of characters: S[L], S[L + 1], ..., S[R], and is called a substring of S. For L > R we mean by S[L, R] an empty string.
Input
The first line of the input file contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contains one string, the string S for the corresponding test case. The input file does not contain any whitespaces.

Output
For each test case output a single line containing the answer for this test case.


Constraints
 1 ≤ T ≤ 10
 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100000
 S consists only of the lucky digits 4 and 7.

Explanation
In the first test case balance substrings are S[1, 1] = 4 and S[1, 2] = 47.
In the second test case balance substrings are S[2, 2] = 4 and S[1, 2] = 74.
Unfortunately, we can't provide you with the explanations of the third and the fourth test cases. You should figure it out by yourself. Please, don't ask about this in comments.

Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of balanced substrings in a given string of 4s and 7s. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the definition of a balanced substring T of length M. It's balanced if there exists an X between 1 and M (inclusive) such that the number of 4s in the prefix T[1 to X-1] is equal to the number of 7s in the suffix T[X to M]. So for example, if the substring is of length 2, like '47', then X could be 1. Because the prefix before X is nothing (so 0 4s), and the suffix from X=1 to 2 is '47' which has one 7. Wait, but 0 vs 1? Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example.

Wait the example given in the problem is S=7477447. The balanced substring is when L=1 and R=7. The split is at X=4. So S[1..4] is 7477, which has 1 four (since positions 2 is 4, and positions 1,3,4 are 7,7,7?) Wait wait, no. Wait S is 7 4 7 7 4 4 7. So S[1,4] is 7,4,7,7. The 4s here are 1. Then S[5,7] is 4,4,7. The 7s here are 1. So 1 equals 1, so it's balanced.

So the idea is that for a substring T (which is a part of S), we split it into two parts before X and after (including X). The number of 4s in the prefix (before X) should equal the number of 7s in the suffix (from X to end). And for the substring to be balanced, there must be at least one such X in it.

The problem is to find all possible substrings (L, R) where L <= R, such that in that substring, there exists such an X.

Now, how to approach this efficiently?

The naive approach would be to check all possible substrings (there are O(n^2) of them for a string of length n) and for each substring check all possible X positions (O(n) per substring). But for n=1e5, that's O(n^3) which is impossible.

So we need a smarter way.

Let's think about the conditions. For a substring S[L..R], which is length M = R-L+1. We need to find if there exists an X (1<=X<=M) such that:

number of 4s in S[L..L+X-2] equals the number of 7s in S[L+X-1..R].

Wait, because in the original definition, the substring T is from position 1 to X-1 (which in the original string is from L to L+X-2) and the suffix is X to M (which is L+X-1 to R).

Wait, T is the substring S[L..R]. Let's say the length of T is M = R-L+1. Then X can be from 1 to M. The prefix is T[1..X-1], which is S[L..L+X-2] (since T's positions are 1-based). The suffix is T[X..M], which is S[L+X-1..R].

So for each possible substring (L, R), we need to check if there's any X such that the count of 4s in prefix is equal to the count of 7s in suffix.

But how can we compute this efficiently?

Let's try to model this. Let's denote:

For the substring S[L..R], the total 4s in the entire substring is total_4. The total 7s is total_7 = (R-L+1) - total_4.

But for the split X, the prefix (before X) has A 4s, and the suffix (from X onwards) has B 7s. The condition is A = B.

But the total 4s in the substring is A + (number of 4s in suffix). Because the prefix is up to X-1, and the suffix includes X. So the 4s in the suffix would be total_4 - A. Similarly, the 7s in the suffix would be (total_7) - (number of 7s in the prefix) + (number of 7s in the suffix). Wait, maybe it's easier to model the suffix's 7s.

Wait the suffix from X to M (T's X to M) is S[L+X-1..R]. The number of 7s in the suffix is equal to the total number of 7s in the substring T minus the number of 7s in the prefix (since the prefix is from 1 to X-1, which is S[L..L+X-2], which is part of the substring T).

Wait, maybe for the substring S[L..R], let's precompute the prefix sums of 4s and 7s.

Let me think of the prefix sum arrays for the entire original string. Let's precompute for the entire string S:

- For each position i, count_4[i] is the number of 4s in S[1..i].
Similarly for count_7[i].

Then, for a substring L..R, the total 4s is count_4[R] - count_4[L-1], and similarly for 7s.

For the split X in the substring (which is X in 1..M, where M = R-L+1), the prefix of the substring (positions 1 to X-1) corresponds to S[L..L+X-2]. The number of 4s in this prefix is count_4[L+X-2] - count_4[L-1], but only if L+X-2 >= L. Otherwise, if X-1 is 0, then it's 0.

Similarly, the suffix of the substring is positions X to M, which is S[L+X-1..R]. The number of 7s here is count_7[R] - count_7[L+X-1 - 1] (since L+X-1 is the start of the suffix, so subtract up to L+X-2). So that's count_7[R] - count_7[L+X-1 -1] = count_7[R] - count_7[L+X-2].

So the condition is:

(count_4[L+X-2] - count_4[L-1]) = (count_7[R] - count_7[L+X-2])

We can rearrange this equation:

count_4[L+X-2] - count_4[L-1] = count_7[R] - count_7[L+X-2]

Rearranging terms:

count_4[L+X-2] + count_7[L+X-2] = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R]

But count_4[L+X-2] + count_7[L+X-2] is equal to (L+X-2) because every position is either 4 or 7. So the left side is (L+X-2). The right side is (count_4[L-1] + count_7[R]).

So the equation becomes:

L + X - 2 = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R]

Let's solve for X:

X = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] - L + 2

But X must be in 1..M, where M = R-L+1.

So substituting M:

X must satisfy 1 ≤ X ≤ R-L+1.

So substituting X into that inequality:

1 ≤ (count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] - L + 2) ≤ R-L+1.

Let me rearrange the equation:

X = (count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] ) - (L - 2)

So X = (count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] ) - L + 2.

Wait, no. Because X is equal to (count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] ) - L + 2?

Wait, let me recheck:

Original equation after rearrangement:

L + X -2 = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R]

So X = (count_4[L-1] + count_7[R]) - L + 2.

Yes.

So X = (count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] ) - L + 2.

So for X to be valid, X must be between 1 and R-L+1, inclusive.

So substituting:

1 ≤ X ≤ R-L+1.

But X is expressed in terms of L and R. So for a given L and R, we can compute X. Then check if X is in the allowed range, and also check if the original condition holds (since this equation is derived from the condition, but perhaps X could be such that L+X-2 is beyond the allowed indices. Wait no, because X is part of the substring, so X can be up to R-L+1. So L+X-2 can be up to L + (R-L+1) -2 = R -1. Which is within the substring's prefix (since the substring is L..R, so up to R-1).

Wait, the prefix is T[1..X-1], which is S[L..L+X-2], because T is the substring S[L..R]. So for X to be 1, X-1 is 0, so the prefix is empty. For X being M, the prefix is up to M-1, which is R- L+1 -1 = R - L. So S[L..R-1].

So for each (L, R), compute X as (count_4[L-1] + count_7[R]) - L + 2. Then check if X is in 1 <= X <= M (where M = R-L+1). If yes, then check if the original condition holds (the number of 4s in the prefix equals the number of 7s in the suffix). But since the equation was derived from the condition, perhaps if X is in the valid range, then the condition holds. So perhaps once X is in the valid range, then (L, R) is counted as a valid substring.

Wait, but how?

Because when we derived X from the equation, that equation must hold. So if X is in the valid range, then the equation holds, which is equivalent to the original condition. So perhaps for each (L, R), if the computed X is in the valid range, then the substring is balanced.

But why?

Let me think again. Suppose we have a substring L..R, and compute X as (count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] ) - L + 2. Then X must be in 1 <= X <= R-L+1. Then substituting into the equation L + X -2 = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R], which came from the original condition. So if X is valid (in the range), then the equation holds, which implies the original condition. Therefore, (L, R) is a balanced substring.

So the algorithm becomes: for each possible substring (L, R), compute X using the formula. Check if X is in [1, M], where M=R-L+1. If yes, then count this substring.

So the problem reduces to finding all (L, R) pairs where X (as computed) is in the valid range. But how do we compute this efficiently?

But even this approach would require checking O(n^2) substrings, which is not feasible for n=1e5. So we need a way to compute the number of (L, R) pairs such that X is in the valid range.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find for each possible X (in the entire string) and see which (L, R) pairs have a split at X.

Wait, maybe there's a way to model this with some mathematical expressions and precompute the counts.

Let me try to model X as (count_4[L-1] + count_7[R]) - L + 2. We need X to be between 1 and M, which is (R-L+1).

So substituting M:

1 <= X <= R-L+1.

But X = (count_4[L-1] + count_7[R]) - L + 2.

So:

1 <= (count_4[L-1] + count_7[R]) - L + 2 <= R - L +1.

Let me subtract 2 from all parts:

-1 <= (count_4[L-1] + count_7[R]) - L <= R - L -1.

Rearranging:

(count_4[L-1] + count_7[R]) - L >= -1.

and

(count_4[L-1] + count_7[R]) - L <= R - L -1.

The second inequality can be rewritten as:

count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] <= R - L -1 + L = R -1.

So:

count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] <= R -1.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express X in terms of L and R.

Another approach: For a given L, can we find all R such that when we compute X, it is within the required range for (L, R)?

But how?

Alternatively, for a fixed X (the split point in the substring), perhaps we can find L and R that satisfy certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering that for each possible split point in the original string (i.e., each position k between 1 and N), find all substrings that include k as the X-th position in their own substring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think of the split in the substring T (L..R) as being at position X. Then, the split in the original string would be at position L + X -1. Let's denote this position as K = L + X -1.

For the condition to hold, the number of 4s in S[L..K-1] (the prefix of T) must equal the number of 7s in S[K..R] (the suffix of T).

Let me denote:

A = number of 4s in S[L..K-1] = count_4[K-1] - count_4[L-1]

B = number of 7s in S[K..R] = count_7[R] - count_7[K-1]

So A = B.

So we have:

count_4[K-1] - count_4[L-1] = count_7[R] - count_7[K-1]

Rearranged:

count_4[K-1] + count_7[K-1] = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R]

But as before, count_4[K-1] + count_7[K-1] = (K-1) - since each position is either 4 or 7, the sum of 4s and 7s up to K-1 is K-1.

So K-1 = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R]

So K = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] + 1.

But K is also equal to L + X -1. Wait, K is the position in the original string where the split occurs. So for a substring starting at L and ending at R, K must be between L and R (since X is between 1 and M=R-L+1, so K ranges from L+0 to L + (M-1) = R).

So substituting K:

L + X -1 = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] + 1.

Wait, no, previous step:

We have K = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] + 1.

But K must also be in [L, R], because X is between 1 and M, so K is between L and R.

So, for a given L and R, if there exists a K in [L, R] such that K = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] + 1, then the substring (L, R) is balanced.

But K has to be between L and R. So for each (L, R), compute K = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] + 1. If K is between L and R, then (L, R) is a valid substring.

Wait, but this seems like a different approach. Because now, for each (L, R), we can compute K and check if it's in the range [L, R]. If yes, then the substring is balanced.

So the problem reduces to counting the number of pairs (L, R) where L <= R, and K = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] + 1 is in [L, R].

This seems manageable. Because for each L and R, we can compute K and check if L <= K <= R.

But again, for n=1e5, checking all O(n^2) pairs is impossible. So we need a smarter way.

Let's think of variables. Let's precompute the count_4 and count_7 arrays.

Then, for each possible R, we can iterate through all possible L's such that K = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] +1 is between L and R.

Alternatively, for each R, find all L's where L <= K <= R, where K = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] +1.

But even that is O(n^2) if not optimized.

Alternatively, for each R, perhaps we can model the equation K = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] +1 and find L's such that L <= K <= R.

But K is a function of L and R. Let's see:

We can write K = (count_4[L-1] ) + (count_7[R] +1)

Let's denote for a fixed R, count_7[R] is known. Let C = count_7[R] +1.

Then K = C + count_4[L-1].

But K must be between L and R.

So for fixed R and C, the equation becomes:

L <= C + count_4[L-1] <= R.

But L is the variable here. For each L (from 1 to R), we can compute count_4[L-1], then compute K, and check if it's between L and R.

But even for a fixed R, checking all L is O(R) which is O(n) per R, leading to O(n^2) total time. Not feasible.

Hmm. So we need a way to find, for each R, the number of L's such that:

L <= C + count_4[L-1] <= R, where C is count_7[R] +1.

But how to find such L's efficiently.

Let me reorganize the inequalities.

First, the lower bound: C + count_4[L-1] >= L.

Rearranged: count_4[L-1] >= L - C.

Second, the upper bound: C + count_4[L-1] <= R.

Rearranged: count_4[L-1] <= R - C.

So for a fixed R and C, the L's must satisfy:

L - C <= count_4[L-1] <= R - C.

But L varies from 1 to R. So for each L, compute count_4[L-1] and check if it's within [L - C, R - C].

But how to find all L's such that this is true?

Alternatively, for each R, we can compute C = count_7[R] + 1. Then, for all possible L, we need count_4[L-1] to be in [L - C, R - C], and also L must be <= R.

Wait, but count_4[L-1] can be precomputed. For example, for L=1, count_4[0] is 0. For L=2, count_4[1] is the number of 4s in the first character. So for each R, we can iterate L from 1 to R and check the conditions. But that's O(n^2) again.

We need a smarter way. Let's think of possible data structures or pre-processing.

Suppose we have the count_4 array. For each R, C is known. Then for each L, we need:

count_4[L-1] >= L - C

and

count_4[L-1] <= R - C.

But how to find the number of L's (1 <= L <= R) that satisfy both.

The key observation is that for each R, C is fixed. So for each R, we can compute the range [A, B] where A = L - C and B = R - C, and count_4[L-1] must be between A and B.

But L is part of the variable here. So for each possible L, we can precompute for all R, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps for each R, we can model this as:

For L in 1..R, check if count_4[L-1] - (L-1) >= (L - C) - (L-1) = 1 - C.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's consider that for each L, the value count_4[L-1] is known.

Let me define for each index i (0-based?), the value of count_4[i] which is the number of 4s in the first i characters (assuming 0-based). So for example, count_4[0] is 0 (since there are no characters before 0), count_4[1] is 1 if S[0] is '4', else 0, etc.

Then, for a given R (1-based in the original string?), count_7[R] is the number of 7s up to R. Then C = count_7[R] +1.

Now, for each possible L (1-based), which is in 1..R, the conditions are:

count_4[L-1] >= L - C

count_4[L-1] <= R - C

But L is in 1..R.

So for each R, we need to find the number of L in 1..R where count_4[L-1] is in [L - C, R - C].

But how?

Let me think of this as for each R, we can compute C, then for each possible L in 1..R, check if count_4[L-1] is between (L - C) and (R - C). The number of such L is the contribution to the answer for this R.

So for each R, the total is the sum over L=1 to R of 1 if (count_4[L-1] >= L - C) and (count_4[L-1] <= R - C).

But even this approach is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

We need a way to compute, for each R, the number of L's where count_4[L-1] is in the interval [L-C, R-C], and L is <= R.

But how to model this.

Let's consider that for a fixed C, and R, we can represent the problem as:

For each L in 1..R, check if count_4[L-1] is in [L - C, R - C].

Let me make a substitution. Let D = L - C. Then the condition is count_4[L-1] >= D and count_4[L-1] <= R - C.

But D = L - C → L = D + C.

Since L ranges from 1 to R, D ranges from 1 - C to R - C.

But this substitution might not help.

Alternatively, for each R, the range R - C is fixed. So the upper bound is R - C.

The lower bound is L - C, which depends on L.

But this seems tricky. How can we find all L where count_4[L-1] >= L - C and count_4[L-1] <= (R - C).

Another way: For a given R and C, the upper bound is fixed (R-C). The lower bound for L is L - C. So for count_4[L-1] to be >= L - C → count_4[L-1] + C >= L.

But count_4[L-1] is known. So for each L, this is a condition.

Wait, count_4[L-1] + C >= L → C >= L - count_4[L-1].

But C is count_7[R] + 1, which is fixed for this R.

So for a fixed R, the condition is:

count_4[L-1] >= L - C → C >= L - count_4[L-1].

But C is a constant here. So for each L, compute (L - count_4[L-1]) and check if C >= that value.

Similarly, the upper bound is count_4[L-1] <= R - C → count_4[L-1] + C <= R → which is always true because C is count_7[R] + 1. Since count_4[L-1] + count_7[L-1] = L-1. So count_4[L-1] + C = (L-1 - count_7[L-1]) + (count_7[R] + 1) = L + (count_7[R] - count_7[L-1]).

But how does this relate to R? For L <= R, count_7[R] >= count_7[L-1], so (count_7[R] - count_7[L-1]) >=0. So count_4[L-1] + C = L + (count_7[R] - count_7[L-1]) -1 + 1 → ?

Wait, perhaps this isn't helpful.

Alternative approach: Let's consider that for each possible L, we can precompute count_4[L-1] and compute for all R >= L, whether the condition holds. But this again leads to O(n^2).

Hmm. Maybe there's a way to model this with some mathematical transformations.

Wait, let's think again about the two conditions:

For a fixed R and C = count_7[R] +1:

1. count_4[L-1] >= L - C
2. count_4[L-1] <= R - C

But L can be up to R.

Let me define for each L, the value of count_4[L-1] - L. Let's call this V_L.

Then, condition 1 becomes V_L >= -C.

Condition 2 becomes V_L <= (R - C) - L.

But R is fixed here. Hmm.

Alternatively, condition 1 can be rewritten as:

V_L = count_4[L-1] - L >= -C.

So V_L >= -C.

And condition 2:

count_4[L-1] <= R - C → V_L <= (R - C) - L → V_L + L <= R - C → V_L <= (R - C) - L.

But (R - C) is fixed for a given R. So for each L, this becomes:

V_L <= (R - C) - L.

But I'm not sure.

Another idea: For each possible L, the value of count_4[L-1] is fixed. So for each L, we can precompute count_4[L-1], and then for a given R and C, we can check if L satisfies the conditions.

But again, this is O(n^2).

We need to find for each R, the number of L's (<=R) such that count_4[L-1] is in [L - C, R - C], where C = count_7[R] +1.

But how to compute this for all R efficiently.

Another observation: For a substring (L, R) to be balanced, there must exist an X in 1..M such that the split at X satisfies the condition. But maybe there's a way to model this for each possible split in the entire string.

Alternatively, let's consider that for each position K in the string (1 <= K <= N), we can find all substrings (L, R) where K is the split point (i.e., K = L + X -1, and X is within 1..R-L+1). For each K, the condition is:

count_4[K-1] - count_4[L-1] = count_7[R] - count_7[K-1]

Rearranged:

count_4[K-1] + count_7[K-1] = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R]

But count_4[K-1] + count_7[K-1] = K-1 (since each character is either 4 or 7). So:

K-1 = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R]

So for a given K, L and R must satisfy:

count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] = K-1.

Additionally, K must be between L and R. Because K is the split point in the substring (L..R), so K >= L and K <= R.

So for each K, we need to find the number of pairs (L, R) such that:

1. count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] = K-1.

2. L <= K <= R.

So the problem now is to, for each K, find the number of (L, R) pairs satisfying these two conditions, then sum over all K.

This seems promising. Because for each K, we can precompute all possible L and R pairs that satisfy the equation and the inequalities.

But how?

Let me think. For a fixed K, the equation is count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] = K-1.

We need L <= K <= R.

So for each K, we can iterate over all possible R >= K, and compute the required L based on R. Or vice versa.

Alternatively, for each K, iterate over R >= K, and compute the required count_4[L-1] = (K-1) - count_7[R], then find how many L's <= K such that count_4[L-1] equals that value and L <= K.

Wait, because L must be <= K (since K >= L).

So for a fixed K and R (>= K), the required L-1 is such that count_4[L-1] = (K-1) - count_7[R].

Then, L-1 can be any index from 0 to K-1 (since L <= K → L-1 <= K-1). So for each R >= K, the number of valid L's is the number of L-1's (which are 0-based indices) where count_4[L-1] equals (K-1 - count_7[R]).

But this would require for each K, and each R >= K, to find the frequency of (K-1 - count_7[R]) in the count_4 array up to index K-1 (0-based).

This approach would be O(n^2) in the worst case, but maybe we can preprocess some frequency tables.

For example, for each K, precompute a frequency map of count_4[0...K-1]. Then for each R >= K, compute the target value (K-1 - count_7[R]) and look up how many times this target appears in the count_4 array up to K-1.

But this is O(n^2) time and space, which is not feasible.

But perhaps we can find for each K, the possible R's and for each R, compute the target and use a hash map or a precomputed array.

Alternatively, for each possible value of (count_7[R], K), precompute the number of L's.

Alternatively, let's think of the following steps:

1. Precompute count_4 and count_7 arrays.

2. For each K from 1 to N:

   a. The required equation is count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] = K-1.

   b. For R to be >= K, and L must be <= K.

   c. For each R >= K, compute target = (K-1) - count_7[R].

   d. The number of valid L's is the number of times count_4[L-1] equals target, where L-1 ranges from 0 to K-1-1 (since L-1 <= K-1-1 implies L <= K).

   So for each R >= K, the valid L's are those with count_4[L-1] = target and L-1 <= K-1-1 → L-1 <= K-2 → L <= K-1.

Wait, L must be <= K (since L <= K). So L can be up to K.

Wait, L is the start of the substring, and K must be in [L, R]. So L can be from 1 to K.

So for a fixed K and R >= K:

The valid L's are those where:

count_4[L-1] = (K-1) - count_7[R]

and L <= K.

L-1 can range from 0 to K-1.

So for each K, the count_4 array up to K-1 (0-based) can be preprocessed with a frequency map. For example, for each K, we can have a dictionary that maps the value of count_4[i] (for i up to K-1) to the number of times it occurs.

Then, for each R >= K, the target is (K-1) - count_7[R], and the number of L's is the frequency of that target in the frequency map of K.

The total for K is the sum over R >= K of the frequency of (K-1 - count_7[R]) in the map for K.

But building frequency maps for each K is O(n) per K, which is O(n^2) time and space, which is not feasible.

Alternative idea: For each possible value of target, precompute a prefix sum array that tracks the occurrences of target in the count_4 array up to each position.

For example, for each value x, create an array pos_x, which contains all indices i where count_4[i] == x. Then, for a given K and target x, the number of valid L-1's (which are <= K-1) is the number of elements in pos_x that are <= K-1.

But how to do this efficiently.

Alternatively, for each x, we can keep a sorted list of the indices where count_4[i] == x. Then, for a query x and K, the number of valid L-1's is the number of elements in the list for x that are <= K-1. This can be found via binary search.

This way, for each K and R, we can compute the target x = (K-1) - count_7[R], then find how many times x occurs in count_4 up to position K-1.

So the steps would be:

1. Precompute count_4 and count_7 arrays.

2. For each x, build a sorted list of indices where count_4[i] == x. For example, a dictionary where the key is x and the value is a list of i's (0-based) where count_4[i] equals x.

3. For each K from 1 to N:

   a. For each R >= K:

      i. Compute x = (K-1) - count_7[R]

      ii. Find how many indices i in the list for x where i <= K-1. This is the number of valid L's for this R and K.

      iii. Add this count to the total.

But this is still O(n^2), which is not feasible.

Hmm. But perhaps there's a way to find, for each K, all R >= K where x = (K-1) - count_7[R] exists in the count_4 array up to K-1.

But even so, how to sum over all R >= K.

Alternative approach: For each K, iterate R from K to N, and for each R, compute x = (K-1) - count_7[R], then query how many times x appears in count_4 up to K-1. Sum all these counts.

But for K from 1 to N, and R from K to N, this is O(n^2) time. Not feasible.

So this approach is not efficient enough.

Alternative idea: For each possible R, compute all K <= R such that count_4[L-1] = (K-1) - count_7[R], and L <= K.

But I'm not sure.

Another observation: Since K must be <= R and >= L, perhaps for each R, K can range from L to R. But this again brings us back to the same problem.

Alternatively, perhaps for each R, we can find all possible K in 1..R, and for each K, compute x = (K-1) - count_7[R], and count the number of L's where count_4[L-1] = x and L <= K. Sum over K.

But this is also O(n^2) time.

Hmm. Maybe there's a mathematical way to model this. Let's think about the possible values of K and R.

For a given R, K can be any value from 1 to R. For each K, the required x is (K-1) - count_7[R].

We need to find the number of L's <= K such that count_4[L-1] = x.

So for each R, the total contribution is the sum over K=1 to R of the number of L's <= K where count_4[L-1] = (K-1) - count_7[R].

But even this is O(n^2) operations.

Alternative idea: Let's precompute for each possible x, the positions where count_4[i] = x. Then, for each R and K, compute x = (K-1) - count_7[R], and find the number of i's <= K-1 where count_4[i] = x.

This can be done using a binary search on the list of positions for x.

But even this requires O(n^2) binary searches, which is O(n^2 log n) time, which is too slow for n=1e5.

So, this approach is not feasible.

We need to find a way to find, for each R, all K's such that x = (K-1) - count_7[R] is present in the count_4 array up to K-1.

But I'm stuck here. Let's think of the problem from another angle.

Alternative approach: Let's model the problem in terms of variables.

For a substring (L, R), the condition is that there exists K in [L, R] such that count_4[K-1] - count_4[L-1] = count_7[R] - count_7[K-1].

Rearranged:

count_4[K-1] + count_7[K-1] = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R].

But the left side is K-1. So:

K-1 = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R].

So for a substring (L, R) to be valid, there must exist a K between L and R such that K-1 = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R].

But K must be in [L, R], so:

L <= K <= R → L <= (count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] + 1) <= R.

Rearranged:

L <= count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] + 1 <= R.

But this is the same as:

L - count_4[L-1] -1 <= count_7[R] <= R - count_4[L-1] -1.

But this seems complicated.

But perhaps for each L, we can find the range of R's where this inequality holds.

Let me try to fix L and see for which R's this is true.

For a fixed L, we need R >= K → K = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] +1.

But R must be >= K → R >= count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] +1.

Hmm, but R and count_7[R] are related, which makes this difficult.

Alternative idea: For each L, let's precompute count_4[L-1] as a value. Let's call this a. Then, for R >= L, we need:

a + count_7[R] +1 >= L → count_7[R] >= L - a -1.

And R >= a + count_7[R] +1 → R - count_7[R] >= a +1.

So for a fixed L and a, the conditions on R are:

count_7[R] >= L - a -1.

and

R - count_7[R] >= a +1.

But how to find such R's.

But for each R, R - count_7[R] is known. Let's denote this as D[R] = R - count_7[R].

So for a fixed L and a, the conditions are:

count_7[R] >= C (where C = L - a -1).

and

D[R] >= a +1.

But D[R] = R - count_7[R] = count_4[R], since count_4[R] + count_7[R] = R.

Wait, because count_4[R] + count_7[R] = R (assuming 0-based index and S is 1-based? Or wait, count_4 is the number of 4s up to position i. For example, for a 1-based string S, count_4[i] is the number of 4s in S[1..i]. So count_4[i] + count_7[i] = i.

So R - count_7[R] = count_4[R].

So D[R] = count_4[R].

So the conditions for R are:

count_7[R] >= C → count_7[R] >= L - a -1.

and

count_4[R] >= a + 1.

But a is count_4[L-1], so a = count_4[L-1].

So the conditions become:

count_7[R] >= L - count_4[L-1] -1.

count_4[R] >= count_4[L-1] + 1.

But how to find R's >= L that satisfy these conditions.

For each L, we can compute C1 = L - count_4[L-1] -1.

And C2 = count_4[L-1] + 1.

Then, for R >= L, we need count_7[R] >= C1 and count_4[R] >= C2.

But how to count the number of R >= L where these two conditions are met.

This seems like a range query problem. If we can precompute for each R the count_7[R] and count_4[R], then for each L, we can query the number of R >= L where count_7[R] >= C1 and count_4[R] >= C2.

But even this requires for each L to perform a query over the range [L, N], which could be O(n) per L, leading to O(n^2) total time.

Which is not feasible.

But perhaps we can preprocess some data structures to allow for efficient range queries.

For example, we can build a 2D prefix sum array where for each R, we store count_4[R] and count_7[R]. Then, for a query [L, N], C1 and C2, we need the number of R >= L where count_7[R] >= C1 and count_4[R] >= C2.

But such a query is not straightforward to answer with standard data structures. Possible options include a segment tree with each node storing a list of (count_4, count_7) for the range, sorted, and then for each query, we can perform a binary search. But this would have a high time complexity.

Alternatively, for each possible R, precompute count_4[R] and count_7[R], and store them in two separate arrays. Then, for a given L, iterate R from L to N and check the conditions. But this is again O(n^2) time.

This seems like a dead end.

Another observation: The problem seems similar to the problem of finding pairs (i, j) where some function of i and j is true. Sometimes these can be solved with inclusion-exclusion or other mathematical tricks.

Let's think again about the initial approach where X must be in [1, M] for the substring (L, R). And X is computed as X = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] - L + 2.

And the substring is valid if X is in [1, R-L+1].

But substituting M = R-L+1, the condition is 1 <= X <= M.

So substituting X into the inequalities:

1 <= count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] - L + 2 <= R - L +1.

Rearranging:

1 <= (count_4[L-1] - L) + (count_7[R] + 2) <= R - L +1.

But this might not help.

Alternatively, the lower bound:

count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] - L + 2 >= 1 → count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] >= L -1.

The upper bound:

count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] - L + 2 <= R - L +1 → count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] <= R - L +1 + L -2 → count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] <= R -1.

So for a valid substring (L, R), the following must hold:

L-1 <= count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] <= R-1.

But how to count the number of (L, R) pairs that satisfy this.

But this is a different way of looking at the condition. For each (L, R), we need the sum of count_4[L-1] and count_7[R] to be between L-1 and R-1, inclusive.

So the problem reduces to counting the number of pairs (L, R) where 1 <= L <= R <= N, and L-1 <= count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] <= R-1.

This is a new perspective. Let's see if this can be optimized.

Let's precompute the count_4 and count_7 arrays.

Then, for each possible pair (L, R), check if L-1 <= (count_4[L-1] + count_7[R]) <= R-1.

But this is again O(n^2).

But perhaps there's a way to model this as a 2D range query problem. For each L, we can find the number of R >= L such that count_7[R] is between (L-1 - count_4[L-1]) and (R-1 - count_4[L-1]).

But the upper bound here is R-1 - count_4[L-1], which depends on R, making it difficult to model.

Alternative approach: Let's consider that for each L, the lower bound is fixed (L-1 - count_4[L-1]), and the upper bound is R-1 - count_4[L-1]. But as R increases, the upper bound increases as well.

For a fixed L, we need R >= L, and count_7[R] >= (L-1 - count_4[L-1]).

Moreover, count_7[R] <= (R-1 - count_4[L-1]).

But count_7[R] is the number of 7s up to R. So count_7[R] <= R.

So for a fixed L, the valid R's must satisfy:

count_7[R] >= (L-1 - count_4[L-1]) → count_7[R] >= C1 (C1 = L-1 - count_4[L-1])

and

count_7[R] <= (R-1 - count_4[L-1]) → count_7[R] + count_4[L-1] +1 <= R.

But this is equivalent to:

count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] +1 <= R → which is the same as the earlier condition.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, for a fixed L, the upper bound on count_7[R] is R-1 - count_4[L-1]. But R is varying. So for each R, this upper bound is R-1 - a (a = count_4[L-1]).

So for each R, we need count_7[R] <= R-1 - a → count_7[R] + a <= R-1.

But a = count_4[L-1], which is a fixed value for the current L.

But count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] <= R-1 → count_4[L-1] <= R-1 - count_7[R] → which is count_4[L-1] <= count_4[R] (because count_4[R] + count_7[R] = R → count_4[R] = R - count_7[R] → R-1 - count_7[R] = count_4[R] -1).

Wait, no. count_4[R] = R - count_7[R], so count_4[R] = R - count_7[R] → R-1 - count_7[R] = count_4[R] -1.

So the condition becomes:

count_4[L-1] <= count_4[R] -1 → count_4[L-1] < count_4[R].

So for a fixed L, the upper bound is count_7[R] <= R-1 - a → which is equivalent to count_4[R] > a.

So the condition for R is:

count_7[R] >= C1 (C1 = L-1 - a)

and

count_4[R] > a.

But how to count R's >= L that satisfy these two conditions.

For each L, the valid R's are those >= L where:

count_7[R] >= C1.

and

count_4[R] > a.

But C1 is L-1 - a, and a is count_4[L-1].

But a = count_4[L-1], so C1 = L-1 - count_4[L-1].

But count_4[L-1] is the number of 4's up to L-1. So L-1 - count_4[L-1] is the number of 7's up to L-1. Because count_4[L-1] + count_7[L-1] = L-1 → count_7[L-1] = L-1 - count_4[L-1].

So C1 = count_7[L-1].

So the conditions for R are:

count_7[R] >= count_7[L-1].

count_4[R] > count_4[L-1].

So for a fixed L, the valid R's are those >= L where count_7[R] is at least count_7[L-1] and count_4[R] is greater than count_4[L-1].

Wait, this is a big insight.

Because:

C1 = L-1 - a = L-1 - count_4[L-1] = count_7[L-1].

So for a fixed L, the valid R's must be >= L and satisfy:

count_7[R] >= count_7[L-1].

count_4[R] > count_4[L-1].

But count_7[R] is non-decreasing, since adding more characters can only increase or keep the same count of 7's. Similarly, count_4[R] is non-decreasing.

Wait, count_4 is the number of 4's up to R, so as R increases, count_4 can either increase by 1 (if the next character is 4) or stay the same (if it's 7). So count_4 is a non-decreasing function.

Similarly, count_7 is also a non-decreasing function.

So for a fixed L, count_7[L-1] is a value. Since count_7 is non-decreasing, for R >= L, count_7[R] >= count_7[L], but count_7[L] >= count_7[L-1] (since L >= L-1). So for R >= L, count_7[R] >= count_7[L-1] is automatically true. Because count_7 is non-decreasing, once R >= L, count_7[R] >= count_7[L-1] (since L >= L-1 +1 is not necessarily true. For example, L=1, R=1: count_7[1] >= count_7[0] (0) is true.)

Wait, count_7 is non-decreasing, so for any R >= L-1, count_7[R] >= count_7[L-1]. So for R >= L, which is >= L-1, count_7[R] >= count_7[L-1]. So the first condition (count_7[R] >= count_7[L-1]) is always satisfied for R >= L.

Thus, the first condition is automatically satisfied. So the only condition is that count_4[R] > count_4[L-1], and R >= L.

So for a fixed L, the valid R's are those R >= L where count_4[R] > count_4[L-1].

But count_4 is a non-decreasing array. So once count_4[R] > count_4[L-1], all R' >= R will also satisfy count_4[R'] > count_4[L-1].

So for each L, the minimal R where count_4[R] > count_4[L-1] is some position, say R0. Then, all R >= R0 will be valid.

Thus, for each L, the number of valid R's is (N - R0 + 1), where R0 is the smallest R >= L such that count_4[R] > count_4[L-1].

If no such R0 exists (i.e., count_4[R] never exceeds count_4[L-1] for R >= L), then there are 0 valid R's.

This is a key insight.

So the problem reduces to for each L, find the minimal R >= L such that count_4[R] > count_4[L-1], and then the number of valid R's is max(0, N - R0 + 1).

But how to compute R0 for each L efficiently.

Since count_4 is a non-decreasing array, for each L, R0 can be found using binary search.

For example, for each L, we can binary search in the range [L, N] to find the first R where count_4[R] > count_4[L-1]. Because count_4 is non-decreasing, the binary search can be applied.

This would allow us to compute R0 in O(log n) per L, leading to O(n log n) time for all L's.

Then, for each L, the number of valid R's is max(0, N - R0 + 1) if R0 exists, else 0.

But how to handle the case where count_4[L-1] is equal to count_4[N]. In that case, there is no R >= L where count_4[R] > count_4[L-1], so the count is 0.

So the algorithm is:

1. Precompute count_4 array.

2. For each L from 1 to N:

   a. a = count_4[L-1].

   b. Find the minimal R >= L where count_4[R] > a. Let's call this R0.

   c. If R0 exists, the number of valid R's is N - R0 + 1.

   d. Sum these counts for all L.

But wait, why is this the case?

Because for each L, the valid R's are those >= L and count_4[R] > a.

Because count_4 is non-decreasing, once R0 is found, all R >= R0 will have count_4[R] > a.

So the number of valid R's is the number of R's from R0 to N.

Which is N - R0 + 1.

But why is this the case?

For example, if R0 is 5 and N is 10, then R can be 5,6,7,8,9,10 → 6 numbers → 10-5+1=6.

Yes.

So this approach would work.

But then, the total number of valid pairs (L, R) is the sum over all L of (N - R0 + 1) if R0 exists.

But why does this approach work? Because we have reduced the problem to the condition that for each L, R must be >= L and count_4[R] > count_4[L-1], which was derived from the original conditions.

But wait, how does this relate to the original problem?

The original problem requires that for a substring (L, R), there exists some X such that the split at X makes the 4s in the prefix equal to the 7s in the suffix. We derived that this is equivalent to the sum count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] = K-1, where K is in [L, R]. Then, after multiple steps, we found that the problem reduces to counting pairs (L, R) where count_4[R] > count_4[L-1], and R >= L.

But why is that?

Ah, because when count_4[R] > count_4[L-1], it implies that there exists K in [L, R] such that K-1 = count_4[L-1] + count_7[R], and K is in [L, R].

But I'm not sure. So let's re-verify.

Wait, the previous steps led us to the conclusion that for a pair (L, R) to be valid, the sum count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] must be between L-1 and R-1, and R >= L.

But under the assumption that count_4 is non-decreasing and count_7 is non-decreasing, the first condition count_7[R] >= count_7[L-1] is always true. So the remaining condition is count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] <= R-1.

But how does this relate to count_4[R] > count_4[L-1]?

Because count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] <= R-1.

But count_7[R] = R - count_4[R], since count_4[R] + count_7[R] = R.

So substituting:

count_4[L-1] + (R - count_4[R]) <= R-1.

Rearranged:

count_4[L-1] - count_4[R] <= -1 → count_4[R] >= count_4[L-1] + 1.

So count_4[R] > count_4[L-1].

Ah! So the condition count_4[L-1] + count_7[R] <= R-1 is equivalent to count_4[R] > count_4[L-1].

Thus, the valid pairs (L, R) are those where R >= L and count_4[R] > count_4[L-1].

So the entire problem reduces to counting the number of pairs (L, R) with L <= R and count_4[R] > count_4[L-1].

This is a huge simplification.

So the solution is to count the number of pairs (L, R) where L <= R and count_4[R] > count_4[L-1].

This is a much easier problem.

Because count_4 is a non-decreasing array, since each character is either a 4 or 7. Adding a 4 increases count_4 by 1, adding a 7 leaves it the same. So count_4 is a non-decreasing array.

Thus, for each L, the R's >= L where count_4[R] > count_4[L-1] form a contiguous range from R0 to N.

Thus, for each L, the number of valid R's is N - R0 + 1, where R0 is the smallest index >= L where count_4[R0] > count_4[L-1].

If no such R0 exists (count_4 remains <= count_4[L-1] for all R >= L), then the count is 0.

So the algorithm becomes:

For each L in 1..N:

- Find the smallest R >= L where count_4[R] > count_4[L-1].

- If such R exists, add (N - R + 1) to the answer.

This is correct because for each such R, all R' >= R will also satisfy count_4[R'] > count_4[L-1].

Now, how to compute R0 efficiently.

Since count_4 is non-decreasing, for each L, we can perform a binary search on the range [L, N] to find the first R where count_4[R] > count_4[L-1].

This will take O(log n) per L, leading to O(n log n) time for all L's.

So, the steps are:

1. Precompute the count_4 array.

2. For each L from 1 to N:

   a. a = count_4[L-1]

   b. Binary search in count_4 from index L to N to find the smallest R where count_4[R] > a.

   c. If found, add (N - R + 1) to the answer.

   d. Else, add 0.

This approach should work.

Let's test this against the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

4
47
74
477
4747477

Sample Output:

2
2
3
23

Let's take the first test case: input is "47".

The string is "4", "7".

count_4 array (0-based):

count_4[0] = 1 (since first character is 4)

count_4[1] = 1 (second is 7, so count remains 1)

For L=1:

count_4[L-1] = count_4[0] = 1.

Find R >=1 where count_4[R] > 1.

The count_4 array from index 1 to 1 is [1]. No elements >1. So no valid R's.

So contribution is 0.

For L=2:

count_4[L-1] = count_4[1] = 1.

Find R >=2 (which is 2). count_4[2-1] = count_4[1] = 1. So no R >=2 where count_4[R] >1. So contribution is 0.

Wait, but according to the sample output, the first test case's answer is 2. But according to this approach, the answer would be 0. So something is wrong.

Wait, this suggests a mistake in the reasoning.

Ah! What's wrong here.

Wait, the sample input 47 has output 2. The valid substrings are (1,1) and (1,2). So according to the approach, we need to see why these are counted.

Let's see for the first test case:

S = '47' → indexes 1 and 2 (1-based).

count_4 is computed as:

count_4[0] = 0 (since S is 1-based)

count_4[1] = 1 (S[1] is '4').

count_4[2] = 1 (S[2] is '7').

So for L=1:

count_4[L-1] = count_4[0] = 0.

We need to find R >=1 where count_4[R] > 0.

In the count_4 array from R=1 to 2:

count_4[1] =1 >0 → yes. So R0 is 1.

So contribution is N - R0 +1 = 2 -1 +1 = 2.

So for L=1, we add 2.

For L=2:

count_4[1] =1. We look for R >=2 where count_4[R] >1. count_4[2] is 1, which is not >1. So contribution is 0.

Total is 2 +0 = 2, which matches the sample.

Ah, so the mistake was in the way the count_4 array is built. The count_4 array is 0-based, where count_4[0] is 0 (number of 4s up to 0 characters), count_4[1] is the number of 4s in S[1], count_4[2] is the number of 4s in S[1..2], etc.

So in the previous example, for L=1, L-1 is 0, so count_4[0] is 0.

Thus, the algorithm is correct.

This explains why the first test case works.

Another sample: input '74', output is 2.

The string is '7', '4'.

count_4 array:

count_4[0] =0

count_4[1] =0 (first character is 7)

count_4[2] =1 (second character is4)

For L=1:

count_4[0] =0. We look for R >=1 where count_4[R] >0. The first such R is 2. So contribution is 2-2 +1=1.

But wait, R0 is 2, so contribution is 2-2+1=1 (since N=2).

So for L=1, the contribution is 1.

For L=2:

count_4[1] =0. Look for R >=2 where count_4[R] >0. R=2 has count_4=1>0. So contribution is 2-2+1=1.

Total is 1+1=2, which matches the sample.

So the approach works.

Thus, the algorithm is correct.

Now, the code.

The code needs to:

For each test case:

- Precompute count_4 array (0-based, length n+1), where count_4[i] is the number of 4s in the first i characters (assuming 1-based string).

Wait, S is 1-based. So for a string of length n, count_4[0] =0.

count_4[i] = count_4[i-1] + (1 if S[i] == '4' else 0).

Then, for each L in 1..n:

a = count_4[L-1]

We need to find the minimal R >= L such that count_4[R] > a.

If found, add (n - R +1) to the answer.

Thus, the code can be structured as follows:

Read T test cases.

For each test case:

   s = input string.

   n = len(s)

   count_4 = [0]*(n+1)

   for i in range(1, n+1):

      count_4[i] = count_4[i-1] + (1 if s[i-1] == '4' else 0)

   ans =0

   for L in range(1, n+1):

      a = count_4[L-1]

      # binary search for the smallest R >= L where count_4[R] > a.

      # the search is in the range [L, n]

      low = L

      high = n

      res = None

      while low <= high:

          mid = (low + high) // 2

          if count_4[mid] > a:

              res = mid

              high = mid -1

          else:

              low = mid +1

      if res is not None:

          ans += (n - res +1)

   print(ans)

This should work.

Testing this code on the first sample:

Test case 1: '47'

count_4 is [0, 1, 1].

L=1:

a = count_4[0] =0.

We search for R>=1 where count_4[R] >0.

In the array, count_4[1]=1>0. So mid is 1, which is found.

res=1. ans += (2-1+1) =2.

L=2:

a=count_4[1]=1.

Search R>=2 (n=2). count_4[2]=1, which is not >1. So no res. ans +=0.

Total is 2. Correct.

Test case 2: '74' → '7','4'.

count_4 is [0,0,1].

L=1:

a=0.

Search R>=1: count_4[1]=0 <=0 → search higher. mid=1.5→2.

count_4[2] =1>0 → res=2. ans += (2-2+1)=1.

L=2:

a=0 (count_4[1] =0).

search R>=2: count_4[2]=1>0 → res=2. ans +=1.

Total is 2. Correct.

Another sample input: '477' → output is3.

Let's see:

S is '4','7','7'.

count_4 is [0,1,1,1].

L=1:

a=0. Find R >=1 where count_4[R] >0.

The earliest is R=1. ans += 3-1+1=3.

L=2:

a=1. Find R >=2 where count_4[R]>1. But count_4[2]=1, count_4[3]=1. So no such R. contribution 0.

L=3:

a=1. Find R >=3. count_4[3]=1. No. contribution 0.

L=4? No, L ranges up to n=3.

Wait, for n=3, L ranges from 1 to 3.

Wait, L=1:

a=0. R0=1. Contribution 3-1+1=3.

But sample output is 3. So why?

Sample input '477' has output 3. According to the code, it would give 3 (from L=1) plus others?

Wait, wait. Let's re-calculate:

Test case 3: input is '477'.

The code's count_4 array is:

indexes 0,1,2,3.

count_4[0] =0.

count_4[1] =1 (s[0] is '4').

count_4[2] =1 (s[1] is '7').

count_4[3] =1 (s[2] is '7').

L=1:

a=0. search R >=1:

count_4[1] =1>0 → R0=1. contribution 3-1+1=3.

L=2:

a=count_4[1] =1. Search R >=2. count_4[2] =1, count_4[3]=1. So no R where count_4[R] >1. contribution 0.

L=3:

a=count_4[2] =1. Search R >=3. count_4[3] =1 → no. contribution 0.

Total ans=3. Which matches the sample.

Yes.

So the code works for this case.

The fourth test case is more complex, but the code should handle it.

Thus, the code is correct.

                            [output] => <think>
Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given string can become a palindrome by deleting exactly one character. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that a palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. So the basic idea is that if the string is already a palindrome, but maybe even then we need to check if removing one character (which would be possible, but wait, the original string's length might be even or odd. For example, if the original string is a palindrome and has even length, then removing one character would make it odd, but maybe not a palindrome. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says to delete exactly one character, and then check if the resulting string is a palindrome. So even if the original is a palindrome, if after deleting any one character, it's no longer a palindrome, then the answer would be no. Wait, but in the sample input, the fourth test case is "abba", which is a palindrome. The output is YES. Because deleting one 'b' gives "aba", which is also a palindrome. So even if the original is a palindrome, but the length is even, like 4, after deleting one character, it's 3. So "abba" becomes "aba" when you delete the second 'b', which is a palindrome. So in that case, the answer is yes.

Wait, but how to handle the case when the original string is a palindrome. For example, if the original string is "aaa", then deleting any one 'a' gives "aa", which is a palindrome. So output is YES.

So the approach is: For each test case, check if there exists a position i such that by deleting the character at position i, the resulting string is a palindrome.

But checking this for every possible position (each character deletion) might be O(n^2) for each test case, which should be acceptable given the constraints, but maybe there's a smarter way.

The constraints weren't given in the problem statement, but assuming that the string can be up to, say, 1e5 characters, then O(n^2) would be too slow. However, in programming competition problems, such a solution might not pass for large n. But the sample input includes a case like "abdbca" which is length 6, but perhaps the problem expects that the solution is efficient enough for the given test cases.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use a two-pointer approach to check in linear time with possible one divergence.

Here's an idea: The standard way to check for a possible palindrome with at most one deletion is to use a helper function that checks if the substring is a palindrome, allowing one skip. So, we can have a helper function that takes two pointers, left and right, and allows one skip. When a mismatch is found, we check two possibilities: skip the left character or skip the right character, and see if either leads to a valid palindrome.

Wait, but how does this apply to the problem here? The problem requires exactly one deletion, not at most one. So if the original string is already a palindrome, then we need to delete exactly one character, and the resulting string must be a palindrome. So, for example, "abba" is a palindrome. If we delete one 'b', then "aba" is still a palindrome. But if the original string is a palindrome with even length, then perhaps deleting the middle two characters (if even) would still leave a palindrome. Wait, but for even length, like "abba", deleting any one character would result in a string of odd length. For example, deleting the first 'a' gives 'bba', which is not a palindrome. So the answer for "abba" is yes because there exists a position to delete (like the second 'b') that leaves a palindrome.

So the problem is not about allowing at most one deletion, but exactly one. So the approach is: For the given string, check if there exists exactly one character to delete such that the resulting string is a palindrome.

But how to efficiently check this?

The two-pointer approach can be modified. Let me think:

We can have a helper function that checks if the substring s[left:right+1] is a palindrome. If not, then we can try deleting either the left or right character and see if either of the resulting substrings is a palindrome.

But since we need to check after exactly one deletion, maybe we can first check if the original string is a palindrome. If it is, then we need to see if after deleting any one character, the resulting string is a palindrome. But for a palindrome of even length, deleting a character in the first half may result in a palindrome. For example, 'abba' becomes 'aba' if you delete the second 'b'. However, for a palindrome of length 4, after deletion of one character, the string is length 3. The middle character can be anything. For example, in 'aba', the first and third characters are the same. So if the original string is a palindrome, then we can delete the middle character (if odd length) and get another palindrome, but for even length, maybe it's possible.

Wait, no. For example, 'abba' is even length. If I delete the first 'b', the string becomes 'ab a' (wait, 'abba' deleting index 1 (the second character) gives 'aba', which is a palindrome. So in that case, yes. So for a palindrome string, if its length is even, then deleting any of the middle two characters (like the first 'b' in 'abba') would leave a palindrome. Wait, no. Let me see:

Original: a b b a (indices 0,1,2,3). Delete index 1: a b a (indices 0,2,3?) Wait, no, the string becomes 'aba' (since after deleting index 1, the characters are a, b, a). So that's a palindrome. So for even-length palindromes, there's at least one way to delete a character to get another palindrome.

But what if the original string is a palindrome of even length? Then, the answer is yes. Wait, let's see. Take 'aaaa' (length 4). Deleting any 'a' would leave 'aaa', which is a palindrome. So yes. So if the original string is a palindrome, then regardless of even or odd length, there exists a way to delete exactly one character and have a palindrome.

Wait, but take 'aba' (length 3). Original is a palindrome. Deleting the middle 'b' gives 'aa' which is a palindrome. So yes. So for any original palindrome, the answer is yes. So the case where the original is a palindrome automatically returns yes.

Wait, but in the sample input, the first test case is 'aaa', which is a palindrome, and the output is yes. Fourth test case 'abba' is a palindrome and output is yes.

But wait, if the original string is a palindrome and its length is 1, then after deleting one character, the string is empty, which is a palindrome. So in that case, the answer is yes. But the problem constraints say that after deletion the size is one less. So for a string of length 1, after deletion, length 0. So the empty string is a palindrome. So that's allowed. So, for the original string being a palindrome, regardless of length, the answer is yes.

But that's not correct. Wait, for example, the string 'a' (length 1). Delete the only character. The resulting string is empty, which is a palindrome. So output is yes.

Another example: 'aa' (length 2). Delete any 'a' to get 'a', which is a palindrome. So yes.

So, in general, if the original string is a palindrome, then the answer is yes. Because you can delete the middle character (for odd length) or any of the middle two (for even) to get a palindrome.

Wait, but this is only if the original string's length is at least 2. Because for a single character, deleting it gives an empty string, which is a palindrome.

So if the original string is a palindrome, then the answer is YES, except when the original string is of length 1. Because then, after deleting one character, it's empty, which is a palindrome. So even then, it's YES.

So for all original palindromes, the answer is YES. Because deleting exactly one character would leave a palindrome. So the answer is YES.

Wait, but what about a palindrome of length 3 where the middle character is different? Wait, no. If it's a palindrome, the first and third characters are the same. For example, 'aba' is a palindrome. Deleting the middle 'b' gives 'aa', which is a palindrome. So yes.

So, the first step is to check if the original string is a palindrome. If it is, then the answer is YES.

But wait, the sample input 4 is 'abba' which is a palindrome, and the output is YES. So that's correct.

But then why the sample input 3 is 'abdbca' (which is not a palindrome) and the output is YES. So the original string isn't a palindrome. So in that case, we need to check if there's a position to delete that would make it a palindrome.

So the approach would be:

For each test case, first check if the original string is a palindrome. If yes, then output YES.

If not, then check whether there exists exactly one character to delete (so, after deletion, the string is a palindrome).

But how?

So the problem is not about the original string being a palindrome. Because even if it's not, we can delete a character and make it a palindrome.

So the plan is:

Check if the original string is a palindrome. If yes, output YES.

Else, check for all possible positions where deleting that character makes the string a palindrome. If any such position exists, output YES, else NO.

But checking each possible position (n positions) and for each, checking if the resulting string is a palindrome (O(n) per check) would be O(n^2) time. For n up to say 1e5, this is not feasible, but perhaps the problem's constraints are small.

But in the sample input, for example, 'abc' is length 3. The original is not a palindrome. Deleting any of the three characters:

Delete 'a' → 'bc' → not palindrome.

Delete 'b' → 'ac' → not.

Delete 'c' → 'ab' → not. So output is NO.

So the code for each test case would be:

For the given string s:

1. Check if s is a palindrome. If yes, return YES.

2. Else, for each i in 0 to len(s)-1:

   a. Create a new string by deleting the i-th character.

   b. Check if that new string is a palindrome.

   c. If any such string is a palindrome, return YES.

3. If none found, return NO.

But this approach could be O(n^2) time. For example, if the string is 1e4 characters, then 1e8 operations, which is probably too slow.

But perhaps in practice, the test cases are small. However, given that the sample input includes 'abdbca' which is length 6, but for larger cases, this approach may not be efficient enough.

So we need a more efficient approach.

The standard way to handle this is to use a helper function that allows checking if the string can be made a palindrome by skipping up to one character. Then, in that process, we can track whether exactly one character was skipped.

Wait, but the problem requires exactly one deletion. So if the original string is not a palindrome, but can be made into a palindrome by deleting exactly one character.

But the helper function for the 'valid palindrome II' problem (Leetcode) allows us to skip one character, either left or right. So in that case, the code can be modified to check that exactly one character is deleted.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to find the first position where the characters don't match, then try skipping the left character and check if the rest is a palindrome. Or try skipping the right character and check. If either is a palindrome, then return YES. But in this approach, the number of deletions is one. Because the original string is not a palindrome, so at least one deletion is needed, and the code checks if one deletion is sufficient.

Wait, but for the problem in Leetcode (valid palindrome II), the problem is to check if the string can be made into a palindrome by deleting at most one character. So in that case, even if the original is a palindrome, it's considered valid. But in our problem, the original being a palindrome is also a valid case (since deleting exactly one character and getting a palindrome). So perhaps the approach is:

Check if the original is a palindrome → if yes, return YES.

Else, check using the helper function (allowing one deletion) → if returns true, then return YES. Else, NO.

But how does the helper function work?

The helper function would check whether the string can be made into a palindrome by deleting at most one character. So, for the problem, the answer is YES if either the original is a palindrome (so deleting any one character would leave a palindrome, but the original must be a palindrome. Wait, no. For example, the original is a palindrome, but after deleting a character, it's not. But the problem requires that after exactly one deletion, the string is a palindrome. So for example, if the original string is 'abba', deleting the first 'a' gives 'bba', which is not a palindrome. But deleting the second 'b' gives 'aba', which is a palindrome. So even though the original is a palindrome, we have to check if there exists at least one character to delete that leaves a palindrome.

So the initial approach of checking if the original is a palindrome, then checking if any of the possible deletions leads to a palindrome is correct, but for large strings, this approach is O(n^2), which is not efficient.

So perhaps a better approach is to:

Check if the original is a palindrome. If yes, return YES.

Else, find the positions where the first mismatch occurs when checking from left and right. Then, check the two possibilities: delete left character or delete right character, and see if either of the resulting substrings is a palindrome.

This is the approach used in the valid palindrome II problem.

Let me think about this.

For example, in the string 'abdbca':

Check left and right pointers:

Start at left=0 (a), right=5 (a). They match. Move left and right inward.

Left=1 (b), right=4 (c). Mismatch. So we need to check two possibilities:

Delete left character (b) and check if the substring from left+1 to right (d, b, c, a) → 'dbca' → but wait, that's not correct. Wait, the current pointers are left=1, right=4. So the characters are s[1] = 'b' and s[4] = 'c' (since the original string is 'a','b','d','b','c','a'). So after deleting left (index 1), the new string would be 'a d b c a' → 'ad bc a' → 'adbc a' (assuming the string becomes 'adbc a', which is 'adbca' (length 5). Checking if this is a palindrome.

Wait, 'a' at start, 'a' at end. Then 'd' vs 'c' next. So no. Not a palindrome.

Alternatively, delete the right character (index 4, which is 'c'), so the string becomes 'abdb a' (since the original is 'a','b','d','b','c','a' → deleting index 4 gives 'abdb a' → 'abdba', which is a palindrome. So this would be a valid case.

So the helper function would find that deleting the right character (index 4) gives a palindrome, so return True.

So the approach is:

Find the first mismatch between left and right pointers.

Check if deleting the left or right character would result in a palindrome.

If either is possible, return YES.

But how to implement this.

So code steps for each test case:

1. Check if the original string is a palindrome. If yes, output YES.

   Wait, no. Because even if the original is a palindrome, we have to delete exactly one character. For example, the original is 'abba'. The code would check if the original is a palindrome (yes), but then need to check if there's a way to delete a character and get a palindrome. But according to the sample input, 'abba' is a yes. But according to the helper function approach, which checks for up to one deletion, the helper function would return yes. But in this case, the original is a palindrome, so the helper function would return true, which would indicate that the answer is yes. But according to the helper function logic, it allows up to one deletion. But in this case, the original is a palindrome, so the helper function would return true (since 0 deletions are allowed).

But the problem requires exactly one deletion. So the helper function approach is not directly applicable.

So the approach has two cases:

Case 1: The original string is a palindrome. Then, we need to check if there exists at least one character to delete such that the resulting string is a palindrome.

Case 2: The original string is not a palindrome. Then, check if there exists exactly one character to delete to make it a palindrome.

So combining these cases.

But how to handle case 1 efficiently.

For case 1, the original is a palindrome. So we need to check if after deleting any one character, the remaining string is a palindrome.

But for a palindrome of length n, after deleting any character, the resulting string's palindrome status depends on which character is deleted.

For example, in 'abba', deleting the first 'a' gives 'bba' which is not a palindrome, but deleting the first 'b' gives 'aba' which is a palindrome.

So in case 1, even though the original is a palindrome, we have to check if there's at least one character whose deletion leaves a palindrome.

But how to check this efficiently.

One approach is: For a palindrome, the minimal way is to delete the first character and check if the resulting string is a palindrome. If yes, then return yes. Otherwise, delete the last character and check. If either is a palindrome, then return yes. If not, then return no.

But this is not sufficient. For example, consider the string 'abcba'. If you delete the middle 'c', you get 'abba', which is a palindrome. But if you delete the first 'a', you get 'bcba', which is not a palindrome. Deleting the first 'b' gives 'acba', which is not a palindrome. So the code that deletes first and last and checks would not find the valid case.

So this approach is not sufficient.

So, for case 1, when the original is a palindrome, we have to check whether there exists any position where deleting that character leaves a palindrome. But for large n, this is O(n^2), which is not efficient.

Alternatively, perhaps in a palindrome, deleting any character except the first half's characters (for even length) or the middle (for odd) would result in a non-palindrome. So perhaps for a palindrome of length >=2, the answer is always yes. Because for example, in a palindrome of even length, deleting the first character may not leave a palindrome, but deleting the middle character (for even length, maybe the middle two?) would. Wait, 'abba' is even. Deleting the middle two characters (indexes 1 and 2) gives 'aa' which is a palindrome. But if you delete index 1, the string becomes 'aba', which is a palindrome. So in this case, the answer is yes.

But what about a palindrome of even length 4, 'aaaa' → deleting any 'a' gives 'aaa', which is a palindrome. So yes.

What about a palindrome of even length 2, 'aa' → deleting either gives 'a', which is a palindrome.

So perhaps for a palindrome of even length, deleting either of the two middle characters would result in a palindrome.

For a palindrome of odd length >=3, like 'aba', deleting the middle 'b' gives 'aa' which is a palindrome. Deleting the first 'a' gives 'ba', which is not. So the answer is yes.

So in general, if the original string is a palindrome, then there exists at least one character to delete to make it a palindrome. So the answer is YES.

Wait, but let's think of a palindrome that is of length 5: 'abcba'. Deleting the middle 'c' gives 'abba', which is a palindrome. So yes.

Another example: 'abbba' (length 5). Deleting the middle 'b' gives 'abba' (palindrome). So yes.

So, for any palindrome of length >=2, the answer is YES. Because, for even length, there are two middle characters (like in 'abba', the two 'b's). Deleting either would leave a palindrome. For odd length, deleting the middle character would leave a palindrome.

So, if the original string is a palindrome, then the answer is YES, provided that the original length is at least 2. But if the original length is 1, then deleting the only character leaves an empty string, which is a palindrome. So even in that case, the answer is YES.

So, in all cases where the original string is a palindrome, the answer is YES.

So the code can be optimized as follows:

For each test case:

1. Check if the original string is a palindrome. If yes, output YES.

2. Else, check if there exists a single character to delete (either by skipping left or right in the first mismatch) such that the resulting string is a palindrome. If yes, output YES. Else, NO.

So the code would first check if the original is a palindrome. If not, then use the helper function to check for the possibility of deleting exactly one character.

So, the steps:

For a given string s:

if is_palindrome(s):

   return YES

else:

   check if by deleting one character (either left or right in the first mismatch), the resulting string is a palindrome. If any of the two possibilities is a palindrome, return YES, else NO.

But how to implement the helper function.

The helper function would be similar to the one in Leetcode's valid palindrome II problem.

Here's the code outline:

def is_palindrome(s):

   return s == s[::-1]

def can_form_palindrome(s):

   left = 0

   right = len(s) -1

   while left < right:

       if s[left] == s[right]:

           left +=1

           right -=1

       else:

           # check two possibilities: delete left or delete right

           # check delete left: s[left+1 ... right]

           # check delete right: s[left ... right-1]

           return is_palindrome(s[left+1: right+1]) or is_palindrome(s[left: right])

   return True

Wait, but this function is for the case where we can delete at most one character. So, if the original string is a palindrome, this function returns True. But in our case, we have to first check if the original is a palindrome (which would return YES), else check if the helper function returns True.

So combining this, the code would be:

for each test case s:

   if is_palindrome(s):

       print("YES")

   else:

       if can_form_palindrome(s):

           print("YES")

       else:

           print("NO")

But wait, the can_form_palindrome function returns True even if the original is a palindrome. But in our code, we have already checked for that, so it's not a problem.

But how does the can_form_palindrome function work when the original is not a palindrome. It checks if by deleting one character (left or right in the first mismatch), the resulting string is a palindrome.

So, for example, in the string 'abdbca', which is not a palindrome. The helper function would find the first mismatch at positions 1 and 4 (characters 'b' and 'c'). Then it checks deleting left (i=1) → substring from 2 to 5 (s[2:5+1] → 'dbca') → which is 'dbca' → is it a palindrome? 'd' vs 'a' → no. Then check deleting right (i=4) → substring from 1 to 4 → s[1:4] → 'bdbca'? Wait, no. Wait, the code is s[left:right], which for left=1 and right=4 (original right is 4). So s[1:4] would be s[1], s[2], s[3], which is 'b', 'd', 'b'. So the substring 'bdb'. Wait, wait the original string is 'abdbca' → indexes 0:a, 1:b, 2:d, 3:b,4:c,5:a.

In the helper function, when left=1 and right=4 (s[1]=b, s[4]=c), the code would check s[left+1:right+1] (left+1=2, right+1=5 → s[2:5] is d, b, c → 'dbc'? No. Wait, in Python, s[a:b] is from index a up to but not including b. So s[2:5] is characters at 2,3,4 → 'd', 'b', 'c' → 'dbc', which is not a palindrome. Then check s[left:right] → s[1:4] → indexes 1,2,3 → 'b', 'd', 'b' → which is 'bdb', a palindrome. So the helper function would return True.

So in this case, the helper function returns True, so the code outputs YES.

So the helper function works for this case.

Another example: 'abc' → the helper function would find the first mismatch at left=0 (a) and right=2 (c). Then check s[1:3] (bc) → not palindrome. Check s[0:2] (ab) → not palindrome. So helper function returns False → code outputs NO.

So this works.

So the code would be:

Read T test cases.

For each s:

if s is a palindrome → YES

else:

   check if deleting one character (via helper) can make it a palindrome → if yes, YES else NO.

But what about cases where the original is not a palindrome, but there are multiple mismatches and deleting a character that is not in the first pair?

For example, the string 'abccdba' → suppose after the first mismatch, the helper function tries deleting the left or right, but the actual solution is to delete a character further along.

But the helper function would only check the first pair of mismatched characters and try deleting left or right. So this could miss some cases.

For example, consider the string 'abcde fgdcba' → wait, maybe this is not a good example. Let's think of a string where the first mismatch can be fixed by deleting either left or right, but after that, there's another mismatch that can't be fixed. Or perhaps a case where the first mismatch's deletion possibilities are not correct, but a later deletion is needed.

For example, the string 'aabcdbaa' → let's see:

The string is 'a', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'b', 'a', 'a'.

Check from left and right:

left=0 (a), right=7 (a) → match.

left=1 (a), right=6 (a) → match.

left=2 (b), right=5 (b) → match.

left=3 (c), right=4 (d) → mismatch.

So the helper function would check deleting left (c) → s becomes 'aabddbaa' (since we delete index 3, the string is 'aabddbaa'? Wait, original string is 'a a b c d b a a' → indexes 0-7. Deleting index 3 (c), the string becomes 'aab d b a a' → 'aabdb aa'? Then check if this is a palindrome. The new string is 'aabdb aa' → which is 'a a b d b a a' → length 7. Check left and right:

left=0, right=6 (a and a → match.

left=1, right=5 (a and a → match.

left=2 (b), right=4 (d → mismatch. So the helper function would return False for this path.

Alternatively, delete the right character (d, index 4). The new string is 'a a b c b a a' → 'aabcb aa' → which is 'a a b c b a a'. Check:

left=0 and 6 (a, a → match.

left=1 and 5 (a and a → match.

left=2 and 4 (b and b → match.

left=3 (c), left=3, right=3. So it's a palindrome. So the helper function returns True.

So the code would return YES.

But in this example, the helper function's approach of checking only the first mismatch and deleting left or right worked.

But what about a case where the first mismatch can't be fixed by deleting left or right, but a later deletion could fix it.

For example, the string 'abbaac'.

Original string is 'a', 'b', 'b', 'a', 'a', 'c'. The original is not a palindrome.

Check left=0 (a) and right=5 (c). Mismatch.

So helper function would check deleting left (a) → 'bbaa c' → 'bbaa c' → 'bbaac' (since after deleting index 0, the string is 'bbaa c' → 'bbaac' which is 'b b a a c'. Check if this is a palindrome: left 0 (b) and right 4 (c → mismatch. So not a palindrome.

Then check deleting right (c), the string becomes 'abbaa'. Check if it's a palindrome. 'abbaa' → length 5. Check left=0 (a) and right=4 (a → match. left=1 (b) and right=3 (a → mismatch. So not a palindrome. So helper function returns False.

But the actual correct deletion is to delete the last 'c' and the second 'a' in the middle. Wait, no. Wait, the string is 'abbaac'. The correct deletion would be to delete the 'c' to make 'abbaa', which is not a palindrome. So perhaps there's no solution.

But then the code would return NO. But what if there's a case where the first deletion is not the correct one but a later deletion is needed?

For example, 'cabac'. Original string is not a palindrome. First mismatch is c vs c (left 0 and right 4). Wait, no. Let me see:

Original string: c a b a c. It is a palindrome. So code returns YES.

Another example: 'caba'. Original is not a palindrome. Check first mismatch: left 0 (c) and right 3 (a). Delete left (c) → 'aba' → palindrome. So helper function returns True.

But what if the string is 'cbaab' → not a palindrome. Let's see:

Left=0 (c) and right=4 (b). Mismatch. So delete left (c → 'baab' → which is a palindrome. So helper function returns True.

So in this case, the code works.

But what if the first mismatch is at positions 0 and 4, and deleting either gives a non-palindrome, but there's a deletion elsewhere that would work.

For example: 'abcdedcbaa' → original string is a palindrome? Let's see: a b c d e d c b a a. No. The first a and last a are same. Next b and a → no. So first mismatch is at positions 1 (b) and 9 (a). So helper function tries deleting left (b) → check s[2:9+1] → substring from 2 to 10 (since Python slicing is up to but not including end. So original string is length 10, indexes 0-9.

So deleting left (index 1) → the substring is s[2:10] → 'cdedcbaa'.

Check if this is a palindrome. 'c d e d c b a a' → first c and last a: no. So not a palindrome.

Delete right (index 9, a) → substring is s[0:9] → 'abcdedcba', which is a palindrome. So helper function returns True.

So code returns YES.

So even though there are multiple mismatches, the helper function's approach of checking the first pair and trying to delete either left or right works.

Thus, the helper function's approach is sufficient.

Thus, the code can be written as:

Check if the original is a palindrome → if yes, return YES.

Else, use the helper function to see if after deleting one character (left or right in the first mismatch) results in a palindrome.

Thus, the code is as follows:

Read T test cases.

For each test case:

s = input().strip()

if s == s[::-1]:

    print("YES")

else:

    left = 0

    right = len(s) - 1

    while left < right:

        if s[left] == s[right]:

            left +=1

            right -=1

        else:

            # check delete left or right

            s1 = s[left+1:right+1]  # after deleting left

            s2 = s[left:right]      # after deleting right

            if s1 == s1[::-1] or s2 == s2[::-1]:

                print("YES")

            else:

                print("NO")

            break

    else:

        print("YES")

Wait, but what if the loop completes without breaking (the else clause of the while loop). This can only happen if the loop condition is not met, i.e., left >= right. Which would imply that all characters matched, so the original is a palindrome. But we have already checked that before entering the else block. So this part of the code is unreachable.

So the code can be:

for each test case:

    s = input().strip()

    if s == s[::-1]:

        print("YES")

    else:

        left = 0

        right = len(s) -1

        found = False

        while left < right:

            if s[left] == s[right]:

                left +=1

                right -=1

            else:

                # check two options

                s1 = s[left+1: right+1]

                s2 = s[left: right]

                if s1 == s1[::-1] or s2 == s2[::-1]:

                    print("YES")

                else:

                    print("NO")

                found = True

                break

        if not found:

            print("YES")

But since the original string is not a palindrome, the loop must have found a mismatch, so the 'found' would be set to True, and the code would have printed YES or NO.

Thus, the code is correct.

But wait, in the case where the original is not a palindrome, the loop will break at the first mismatch, check s1 and s2, and print YES or NO.

So, this code should handle all cases.

Testing the sample input:

Sample Input 4:

4

aaa → is a palindrome → print YES.

abc → not a palindrome. Mismatch at a and c. Check s1 (bc) and s2 (ab). Neither is palindrome → print NO.

abdbca → not a palindrome. Mismatch at b and c. Check s1 (d,b,c,a) → s[left+1:right+1] is s[2:5+1] → indexes 2-5 (d, b, c, a) → 'dbca' → no. s2 is s[1:4] → 'bdb c' → no. Wait, wait, the original string is 'abdbca' → indexes 0:a,1:b,2:d,3:b,4:c,5:a. So left is 1, right is 4. So s1 = s[2:5] (since right+1 is 5 → indexes 2,3,4 → d, b, c → 'dbc' which is not a palindrome. s2 is s[1:4] → indexes 1,2,3 → b, d, b → 'bdb' which is a palindrome. So the code would print YES.

Fourth test case: abba → is a palindrome → print YES.

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: 'abba' → code outputs YES.

Another test case: 'a' → is a palindrome → YES.

Another test case: 'aa' → YES.

Another test case: 'ab' → not a palindrome. Check s1 (b) → palindrome. So output YES. Wait, no. 'ab' → after deleting 'a', we get 'b' → palindrome. So code should output YES.

Wait, but according to the code:

s = 'ab'. It is not a palindrome.

In the loop:

left=0, right=1. s[0] = 'a', s[1] = 'b' → mismatch.

s1 is s[1:2] → 'b' → palindrome. So code prints YES.

So for input 'ab', output is YES.

But according to the problem statement, the sample input 'abba' is YES because deleting one 'b' gives 'aba'. But according to the code, 'ab' would return YES. But according to the problem statement, the answer depends on whether the resulting string is a palindrome after exactly one deletion.

So for 'ab', the code is correct.

Thus, the code is correct.

 1. new ingredients needed, 2. a special recipe to make it, 3. step-by-step instructions to make the Dijon mustard mayonnaise.

### 1. New Ingredients Needed

To make Dijon mustard mayonnaise, you will need the following ingredients:

- **1/4 cup of mayonnaise**
- **1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard**
- **1 tablespoon of olive oil**
- **1 tablespoon of white wine vinegar**
- **1/2 teaspoon of salt**
- **A dash of paprika (optional, for color)**

### 2. Special Recipe

**-record player skipping-**
**Deches** Dijon Mustard Mayonnaise Recipe is a twist on classic mayonnaise, infused with a touch of French flair with Dijon mustard.

### 3. Step-by-step Instructions to Make Dijon Mustard Mayonnaise

1. **Measure Your Ingredients**: Gather all the necessary ingredients and measure them out. It's always a good idea to have everything ready before you begin.

2. **Place in a Mixing Bowl**: Combine the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, white wine vinegar, and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl.

3. **Add Oil and Vinegar**: Pour in the olive oil and white wine vinegar and mix well. Dijon mustard mayonnaise's key differentiator is that it requires less mayonnaise than a standard mayonnaise, but the vinegar helps bring it all together.

4. **Whisk or Mix**: Whisk the mixture until well combined. At this point, the mixture will continue to thicken as you stir.

5. **Adjust to Taste**: Taste the mixture then adjust the seasoning with more mustard, vinegar, salt, or pepper if needed.

6. **Optional Extra Step - Addings**: If you’d like to add a little color, you can sprinkle a dash of paprika on top and mix gently.

7. **Store**: Transfer the Dijon mustard mayonnaise to an airtight container. Store it in the refrigerator and it will keep for up to 1 week when properly refrigerated.

8. **Server with**: Serve with your favorite sandwiches, wraps, pretzels, or on top of potato salads or coleslaw.

Enjoy your homemade Dijon mustard mayonnaise!

/*
 Choosing the "best" French cheese can be subjective and depends on personal taste, as France offers a wide variety of exceptional cheeses. However, some French cheeses are world-renowned for their unique flavors and qualities. Here are a few notable ones:

1. **Brie de Meaux**: Often referred to as the "King of Cheeses," Brie de Meaux is a soft cheese with a creamy interior and a white, edible rind. It has a rich, buttery flavor.

2. **Camembert de Normandie**: Another famous soft cheese, Camembert has a strong, earthy flavor and a creamy texture. It's known for its distinctive white, bloomy rind.

3. **Roquefort**: This is a blue cheese made from sheep's milk, known for its tangy, salty flavor and distinctive blue veins. It's one of the world's best-known blue cheeses.

4. **Comté**: A hard cheese made from unpasteurized cow's milk, Comté has a complex flavor profile that can include notes of fruit, spice, and nuts. It's often used in fondue.

5. **Reblochon**: A soft washed-rind and smear-ripened cheese from the Alps, Reblochon has a strong aroma and a creamy, nutty flavor. It's a key ingredient in the dish Tartiflette.

6. **Époisses**: This is a pungent, washed-rind cheese with a strong smell and a rich, salty flavor. It's not for the faint-hearted but is highly regarded by cheese connoisseurs.

Each of these cheeses offers a unique experience, so the "best" one will depend on your personal preference.

### Resume of the Document

**Title: Born-Again Neural Networks**

**Authors:**
- Tommaso Furlanello
- Zachary C. Lipton
- Michael Tschannen
- Laurent Itti
- Anima Anandkumar

**Abstract:**
The paper introduces the concept of Born-Again Networks (BANs), which involves training neural networks (students) using the outputs of previously trained networks (teachers) of identical architecture. Surprisingly, these BANs outperform their teachers in various tasks, including computer vision and language modeling. The study explores different distillation objectives and demonstrates that BANs achieve state-of-the-art performance on datasets like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

**Introduction:**
The paper revisits the concept of Knowledge Distillation (KD), traditionally used for model compression, and proposes a new approach where students are trained to mimic their teachers of identical capacity. This method, inspired by Breiman's ensemble techniques and Minsky's teaching selves, shows that students can outperform their teachers.

**Related Literature:**
The paper reviews related work on KD and model compression, highlighting the evolution from early methods to recent advancements in deep learning. It also discusses the use of KD in various domains, including reinforcement learning and continual learning.

**Born-Again Networks (BANs):**
BANs are trained using a combination of true labels and the teacher's output distribution. The gradient induced by KD is decomposed into dark knowledge and ground-truth components. The paper explores different distillation objectives, such as Confidence-Weighted by Teacher Max (CWTM) and Dark Knowledge with Permuted Predictions (DKPP), to understand the essential components of KD.

**Experiments:**
Experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Penn Tree Bank datasets. BANs demonstrate significant improvements over their teachers across different architectures, including DenseNets and ResNets. The paper also explores the effect of varying network depth, width, and compression rates, as well as the impact of removing dark knowledge components.

**Results:**
BANs consistently outperform their teachers in various configurations. For instance, BAN-DenseNets achieve lower validation errors on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. The sequence of teaching selves and ensembles of BANs further improve performance. The removal of dark knowledge components still yields improvements, indicating the robustness of the BAN approach.

**Discussion:**
The paper discusses the implications of the BAN approach, drawing parallels with Minsky's Society of Mind. It concludes that the transfer of knowledge between identical networks can lead to significant performance gains, challenging the conventional wisdom of model compression.

**Acknowledgements:**
The work was supported by various institutions and grants, including the National Science Foundation and Intel Corporation.

**References:**
The paper cites numerous works related to KD, model compression, and deep learning, providing a comprehensive overview of the relevant literature.

#### Abstract

Knowledge Distillation (KD) consists of transferring "knowledge" from one machine learning model (the teacher) to another (the student). Commonly, the teacher is a high-capacity model with formidable performance, while the student is more compact. By transferring knowledge, one hopes to benefit from the student's compactness, without sacrificing too much performance. We study KD from a new perspective: rather than compressing models, we train students parameterized identically to their teachers. Surprisingly, these Born-Again Networks (BANs), outperform their teachers significantly, both on computer vision and language modeling tasks. Our experiments with BANs based on DenseNets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 (3.5\%) and CIFAR-100 (15.5\%) datasets, by validation error. Additional experiments explore two distillation objectives: (i) Confidence-Weighted by Teacher Max (CWTM) and (ii) Dark Knowledge with Permuted Predictions (DKPP). Both methods elucidate the essential components of KD, demonstrating the effect of the teacher outputs on both predicted and nonpredicted classes.


## 1. Introduction

In a 2001 paper on statistical modeling (Breiman et al., 2001), Leo Breiman noted that different stochastic algorithmic procedures (Hansen \& Salamon, 1990; Liaw et al., 2002; Chen \& Guestrin, 2016) can lead to diverse models with similar validation performances. Moreover, he noted that we can often compose these models into an ensemble that achieves predictive power superior to each of the constituent

[^0]models. Interestingly, given such a powerful ensemble, one can often find a simpler model - no more complex than one of the ensemble's constituents - that mimics the ensemble and achieves its performance. Previously, in Born-Again Trees Breiman \& Shang (1996) pioneered this idea, learning single trees that match the performance of multiple-tree predictors. These born-again trees approximate the ensemble decision but offer some desired properties of individual decision trees, such as their purported amenability to interpretation. A number of subsequent papers have proposed variations the idea of born-again models. In the neural network community, similar ideas emerged in papers on model compression by Bucilua et al. (2006) and related work on knowledge distillation (KD) by Hinton et al. (2015). In both cases, the idea is typically to transfer the knowledge of a high-capacity teacher with desired high performance to a more compact student (Ba \& Caruana, 2014; Urban et al., 2016; Rusu et al., 2015). Although the student cannot match the teacher when trained directly on the data, the distillation process brings the student closer to matching the predictive power of the teacher.

We propose to revisit KD with the objective of disentangling the benefits of this training technique from its use in model compression. In experiments transferring knowledge from teachers to students of identical capacity, we make the surprising discovery that the students become the masters, outperforming their teachers by significant margins. In a manner reminiscent to Minsky's Sequence of Teaching Selves (Minsky, 1991), we develop a simple re-training procedure: after the teacher model converges, we initialize a new student and train it with the dual goals of predicting the correct labels and matching the output distribution of the teacher. We call these students Born-Again Networks (BANs) and show that applied to DenseNets, ResNets and LSTM-based sequence models, BANs consistently have lower validation errors than their teachers. For DenseNets, we show that this procedure can be applied for multiple steps, albeit with diminishing returns.

We observe that the gradient induced by KD can be decomposed into two terms: a dark knowledge term, containing the information on the wrong outputs, and a ground-truth component which corresponds to a simple rescaling of the original gradient that would be obtained using the real labels. We interpret the second term as training from the real

Figure 1. Graphical representation of the BAN training procedure: during the first step the teacher model T is trained from the labels $Y$. Then, at each consecutive step, a new identical model is initialized from a different random seed and trained from the supervision of the earlier generation. At the end of the procedure, additional gains can be achieved with an ensemble of multiple students generations.
labels using importance weights for each sample based on the teacher's confidence in its maximum value. Experiments investigating the importance of each term are aimed at quantifying the contribution of dark knowledge to the success of KD.

Furthermore, we explore whether the objective function induced by the DenseNet teacher can be used to improve a simpler architecture like ResNet bringing it close to state-of-the-art accuracy. We construct Wide-ResNets (Zagoruyko \& Komodakis, 2016b) and Bottleneck-ResNets (He et al., 2016b) of comparable complexity to their teacher and show that these BAN-as-ResNets surpass their DenseNet teachers. Analogously we train DenseNet students from Wide-ResNet teachers, which drastically outperform standard ResNets. Thus, we demonstrate that weak masters can still improve performance of students, and KD need not be used with strong masters.

## 2. Related Literature

We briefly review the related literature on knowledge distillation and the models used in our experiments.

### 2.1. Knowledge Distillation

A long line of papers have sought to transfer knowledge between one model and another for various purposes. Sometimes the goal is compression: to produce a compact model that retains the accuracy of a larger model that takes up more space and/or requires more computation to make predictions (Bucilua et al., 2006; Hinton et al., 2015). Breiman \& Shang (1996) proposed compressing neural networks and multipletree predictors by approximating them with a single tree. More recently, others have proposed to transfer knowledge
from neural networks by approximating them with simpler models like decision trees (Chandra et al., 2007) and generalized additive models (Tan et al., 2018) for the purpose of increasing transparency or interpretability. Further, Frosst \& Hinton (2017) proposed distilling deep networks into decision trees for the purpose of explaining decisions. We note that in each of these cases, what precisely is meant by interpretability or transparency is often undeclared and the topic remains fraught with ambiguity (Lipton, 2016).

Among papers seeking to compress models, the goal of knowledge transfer is simple: produce a student model that achieves better accuracy by virtue of knowledge transfer from the teacher model than it would if trained directly. This research is often motivated by the resource constraints of underpowered devices like cellphones and internet-offthings devices. In a pioneering work, Bucilua et al. (2006) compress the information in an ensemble of neural networks into a single neural network. Subsequently, with modern deep learning tools, Ba \& Caruana (2014) demonstrated a method to increase the accuracy of shallow neural networks, by training them to mimic deep neural networks, using an penalizing the L2 norm of the difference between the student's and teacher's logits. In another recent work, Romero et al. (2014) aim to compress models by approximating the mappings between teacher and student hidden layers, using linear projection layers to train the relatively narrower students.

Interest in KD increased following Hinton et al. (2015), who demonstrated a method called dark knowledge, in which a student model trains with the objective of matching the full softmax distribution of the teacher model. One paper applying ML to Higgs Boson and supersymmetry detection, made the (perhaps inevitable) leap to applying dark knowledge to the search for dark matter (Sadowski et al.,

            [markdown] => 2015). Urban et al. (2016) train a super teacher consisting of an ensemble of 16 convolutional neural networks and compresses the learned function into shallow multilayer perceptrons containing 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 layers. In a different approach, Zagoruyko \& Komodakis (2016a) force the student to match the attention map of the teacher (norm across the channel dimension in each spatial location) at the end of each residual stage. Czarnecki et al. (2017) try to minimize the difference between teacher and student derivatives of the loss with respect to the input in addition to minimizing the divergence from teacher predictions.

Interest in KD has also spread beyond supervised learning. In the deep reinforcement learning community, for example, Rusu et al. (2015) distill multiple DQN models into a single one. A number of recent papers (Furlanello et al., 2016; Li \& Hoiem, 2016; Shin et al., 2017) employ KD for the purpose of minimizing forgetting in continual learning. (Papernot et al., 2016) incorporate KD into an adversarial training scheme. Recently, Lopez-Paz et al. (2015) pointed out some connections between KD and a theory of on learning with privileged information (Pechyony \& Vapnik, 2010).
In a superficially similar work to our own, Yim et al. (2017) propose applying KD from a DNN to another DNN of identical architecture, and report that the student model trains faster and achieves greater accuracy than the teacher. They employ a loss which is calculated as follows: for a number of pairs of layers $\{\{i, j\}\}$ of same dimensionality, they (i) calculate a number of inner products $G_{i, j}(\boldsymbol{x})$ between the activation tensors at the layers $i$ and $j$, and (ii) they construct a loss that requires the student to match the statistics of these inner products to the corresponding statistics calculated on the teacher (for the same example), by minimizing $\left\|G_{i, j}^{T}(\boldsymbol{x})-G_{i, j}^{S}(\boldsymbol{x})\right\|_{2}^{2}$. The authors exploit a statistic used in Gatys et al. (2015) to capture style similarity between images (given the same network).

Key differences Our work differs from (Yim et al., 2017) in several key ways. First, their novel loss function, while technically imaginative, is not demonstrated to outperform more standard KD techniques. Our work is the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that dark knowledge, applied for self-distillation, even without softening the logits results in significant boosts in performance. Indeed, when distilling to a model of identical architecture we achieve the current second-best performance on the CIFAR100 dataset. Moreover, this paper offers empirical rigor, providing several experiments aimed at understanding the efficacy of self-distillation, and demonstrating that the technique is successful in domains other than images.

### 2.2. Residual and Densely Connected Neural Networks

First described in (He et al., 2016a), deep residual networks employ design principles that are rapidly becoming ubiquitous among modern computer vision models. The Resnet passes representations through a sequence of consecutive residual-blocks, each of which applies several sub-modules, denoted residual units), each of which consists of convolutions and skip-connections, interspersed with spatial downsampling. Multiple extensions (He et al., 2016b; Zagoruyko \& Komodakis, 2016b; Xie et al., 2016; Han et al., 2016) have been proposed, progressively increasing their accuracy on CIFAR100 (Krizhevsky \& Hinton, 2009) and ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015). Densely connected networks (DenseNets) (Huang et al., 2016) are a recently proposed variation where the summation operation at the end of each unit is substituted by a concatenation of the input and output of the unit.

## 3. Born-Again Networks

Consider the classical image classification setting where we have a training dataset consisting of tuples of images and labels $(x, y) \in \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y}$ and we are interested in fitting a function $f(x): \mathcal{X} \mapsto \mathcal{Y}$, able to generalize to unseen data. Commonly, the mapping $f(x)$ is parametrized by a neural network $f\left(x, \theta_{1}\right), \theta_{1}$ with parameters in some space $\Theta_{1}$. We learn the parameters via Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), producing a resulting model $\theta_{1}^{*}$ that minimizes some loss function:

$$
\theta_{1}^{*}=\underset{\theta_{1}}{\arg \min } \mathcal{L}\left(y, f\left(x, \theta_{1}\right)\right)
$$

typically optimized by some variant of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

Born-Again Networks (BANs) are based on the empirical finding demonstrated in knowledge distillation / model compression papers that generalization error, can be reduced by modifying the loss function. This should not be surprising: the most common such modifications are the classical regularization penalties which limit the complexity of the learned model. BANs instead exploit the idea demonstrated in KD, that the information contained in a teacher model's output distribution $f\left(x, \theta_{1}^{*}\right)$ can provide a rich source of training signal, leading to a second solution $f\left(x, \theta_{2}^{*}\right), \theta_{2} \in \Theta_{2}$, with better generalization ability. We explore techniques to modify, substitute, or regularize the original loss function with a KD term based on the cross-entropy between the new model's outputs and the outputs of the original model:

$$
\mathcal{L}\left(f\left(x, \underset{\theta_{1}}{\arg \min } \mathcal{L}\left(y, f\left(x, \theta_{1}\right)\right)\right), f\left(x, \theta_{2}\right)\right)
$$

Unlike the original works on KD, we address the case when

            [markdown] => the teacher and student networks have identical architectures. Additionally, we present experiments addressing the case when the teacher and student networks have similar capacity but different architectures. For example we perform knowledge transfer from a DenseNet teacher to a ResNet student with similar number of parameters.

### 3.1. Sequence of Teaching Selves Born-Again Networks Ensemble

Inspired by the impressive recent results of SGDR WideResnet (Loshchilov \& Hutter, 2016) and Coupled-DenseNet (Dutt et al., 2017) ensembles on CIFAR100, we apply BANs sequentially with multiple generations of knowledge transfer. In each case, the $k$-th model is trained, with knowledge transferred from the $k-1$-th student:

$$
\mathcal{L}\left(f\left(x, \underset{\theta_{k-1}}{\arg \min } \mathcal{L}\left(f\left(x, \theta_{k-1}\right)\right)\right), f\left(x, \theta_{k}\right)\right)
$$

Finally, similarly to ensembling multiple snapshots (Huang et al., 2017) of SGD with restart (Loshchilov \& Hutter, 2016), we produce Born-Again Network Ensembles (BANE) by averaging the prediction of multiple generations of BANs.

$$
\hat{f}^{k}(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{k} f\left(x, \theta_{i}\right) / k
$$

We find the improvements of the sequence to saturate, but we are able to produce significant gains through ensembling.

### 3.2. Dark Knowledge Under the Light

The authors in (Hinton et al., 2015) suggest that the success of KD depends on the dark knowledge hidden in the distribution of logits of the wrong responses, that carry information on the similarity between output categories. Another plausible explanations might be found by comparing the gradients flowing through output node corresponding to the correct class during distillation vs. normal supervised training. Note that restricting attention to this gradient, the knowledge distillation might resemble importance-weighting where the weight corresponds to the teacher's confidence in the correct prediction.

The single-sample gradient of the cross-entropy between student logits $z_{j}$ and teacher logits $t_{j}$ with respect to the $i$ th output is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{i}}{\partial z_{i}}=q_{i}-p_{i}=\frac{e^{z_{i}}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{z_{j}}}-\frac{e^{t_{i}}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{t_{j}}}
$$

When the target probability distribution function corresponds to the ground truth $*$ one-hot label $p_{*}=y_{*}=1$
this reduces to:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{*}}{\partial z_{*}}=q_{*}-y_{*}=\frac{e^{z_{*}}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{z_{j}}}-1
$$

When the loss is computed with respect to the complete teacher output, the student back-propagates the mean of the gradients with respect to correct and incorrect outputs across all the $b$ samples $s$ of the mini-batch (assuming without loss of generality the $n$th label is the ground truth label $*$ ):

$$
\sum_{s=1}^{b} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{i, s}}{\partial z_{i, s}}=\sum_{s=1}^{b}\left(q_{*, s}-p_{*, s}\right)+\sum_{s=1}^{b} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\left(q_{i, s}-p_{i, s}\right)
$$

up to a rescaling factor $1 / b$. The second term corresponds to the information incoming from all the wrong outputs, via dark knowledge. The first term corresponds to the gradient from the correct choice and can be rewritten as

$$
\frac{1}{b} \sum_{s=1}^{b}\left(q_{*, s}-p_{*, s} y_{*, s}\right)
$$

which allows the interpretation of the output of the teacher $p_{*}$ as a weighting factor of the original ground truth label $y_{*}$.

When the teacher is correct and confident in its output, i.e. $p_{*, s} \approx 1$, Eq. (8) reduces to the ground truth gradient in Eq. (6), while samples with lower confidence have their gradients rescaled by a factor $p_{*, s}$ and have reduced contribution to the overall training signal.

We notice that this form has a relationship with importance weighting of samples where the gradient of each sample in a mini-batch is balanced based on its importance weight $w_{s}$. When the importance weights correspond to the output of a teacher for the correct dimension we have:

$$
\sum_{s=1}^{b} \sum_{\substack{u=1 \\ u=1}}^{b} w_{u}\left(q_{*, s}-y_{*, s}\right)=\sum_{s=1}^{b} \frac{p_{*, s}}{\sum_{u=1}^{b} p_{*, u}}\left(q_{*, s}-y_{*, s}\right)
$$

So we ask the following question: does the success of dark knowledge owe to the information contained in the nonargmax outputs of the teacher? Or is dark knowledge simply performing a kind of importance weighting? To explore these questions, we develop two treatments. In the first treatment, Confidence Weighted by Teacher Max (CWTM), we weight each example in the student's loss function (standard cross-entropy with ground truth labels) by the confidence of the teacher model on that example (even if the teacher wrong). We train BAN models using an approximation of Eq. (9), where we substitute the correct answer $p_{*, s}$ with

$$
\sum_{s=1}^{b} \frac{\max p_{., s}}{\sum_{u=1}^{b} \max p_{., u}}\left(q_{*, s}-y_{*, s}\right)
$$

In the second treatment, dark knowledge with Permuted Predictions (DKPP), we permute the non-argmax outputs of the teacher's predicted distribution. We use the original formulation of Eq. (7), substituting the $*$ operator with max and permuting the teacher dimensions of the dark knowledge term, leading to:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{s=1}^{b} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{i, s}}{\partial z_{i, s}}= & \sum_{s=1}^{b}\left(q_{*, s}-\max p_{., s}\right) \\
& +\sum_{s=1}^{b} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} q_{i, s}-\phi\left(p_{j, s}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\phi\left(p_{j, s}\right)$ are the permuted outputs of the teacher. In DKPP we scramble the correct attribution of dark knowledge to each non-argmax output dimension, destroying the pairwise similarities of the original output covariance matrix.

### 3.3. BANs Stability to Depth and Width Variations

DenseNet architectures are parametrized by depth, growth, and compression factors. Depth corresponds to the number of dense blocks. The growth factor defines how many new features are concatenated at each new dense block, while the compression factor controls by how much features are reduced at the end of each stage.

Variations in these hyper-parameters induce a tradeoff between number of parameters, memory use and the number of sequential operations for each pass. We test the possibility of expressing the same function of the DenseNet teacher with different architectural hyperparameters. In order to construct a fair comparison, we construct DenseNets whose output dimensionality at each spatial transition matches that of the DenseNet-90-60 teacher. Keeping the size of the hidden states constant, we modulate the growth factor indirectly via the choice the number of blocks. Additionally, we can drastically reduce the growth factor by reducing the compression factor before or after each spatial transition.

### 3.4. DenseNets Born-Again as ResNets

Since BAN-DenseNets perform at the same level as plain DenseNets with multiples of their parameters, we test whether the BAN procedure can be used to improve ResNets as well. Instead of the weaker ResNet teacher, we employ a DenseNet-90-60 as teacher and construct comparable ResNet students by switching Dense Blocks with Wide Residual Blocks and Bottleneck Residual Blocks.

## 4. Experiments

All experiments performed on CIFAR-100 use the same preprocessing and training setting as for Wide-ResNet (Zagoruyko \& Komodakis, 2016b) except for Mean-Std normalization. The only form of regularization used other than the KD loss are weight decay and, in the case of WideResNet drop-out.

### 4.1. CIFAR-10/100

Baselines To get a strong teacher baseline without the prohibitive memory usage of the original architectures, we explore multiple heights and growth factors for DenseNets. We find a good configuration in relatively shallower architectures with increased growth factor and comparable number of parameters to the largest configuration of the original paper. Classical ResNet baselines are trained following (Zagoruyko \& Komodakis, 2016b). Finally, we construct Wide-ResNet and bottleneck-ResNet networks that match the output shape of DenseNet-90-60 at each block, as baselines for our BAN-ResNet with DenseNet teacher experiment.

BAN-DenseNet and ResNet We perform BAN retraining after convergence, using the same training schedule originally used to train the teacher networks. We employ DenseNet-(116-33, 90-60, 80-80, 80-120) and train a sequence of BANs for each configuration. We test the ensemble performance for sequences of 2 and 3 BANs. We explored other forms of knowledge transfer for training BANs. Specifically, we tried progressively constraining the BANs to be more similar to their teachers, sharing the first and last layers between student and teacher, or adding losses that penalize the L2 distance between student and teacher activations. However, we found these variations to systematically perform slightly worse than the simple KD via cross entropy. For BAN-ResNet experiments with a ResNet teacher we use Wide-ResNet-(28-1, 28-2, 28-5, 28-10).

BAN without Dark Knowledge In the first treatment, CWTM, we fully exclude the effect of all the teacher's output except for the argmax dimension. To do so, we train the students with the normal label loss where samples are weighted by their importance. We interpret the max of the teacher's output for each sample as the importance weight and use it to rescale each sample of the student's loss.

In the second treatment, DKPP, we maintain the overall high order moments of the teachers output, but randomly permute each output dimension except the argmax one. We maintain the rest of the training scheme and the architecture unchanged.

Both methods alter the covariance between outputs, such

Variations in Depth, Width and Compression Rate We also train variations of DenseNet-90-60, with increased or decreased number of units in each block and different number of channels determined through a ratio of the original activation sizes.

BAN-Resnet with DenseNet teacher In all the BANResNet with DenseNet teacher experiments, the student shares the first and last layers of the teacher. We modulate the complexity of the ResNet by changing the number of units, starting from the depth of the successful Wide-ResNet28 (Zagoruyko \& Komodakis, 2016b) and reducing until only a single residual unit per block remains. Since the number of channels in each block is the same for every residual unit, we match it with a proportion of the corresponding dense block output after the $1 \times 1$ convolution, before the spatial down-sampling. We explore mostly architectures with a ratio of 1 , but we also show the effect of halving the width of the network.

BAN-DenseNet with ResNet teacher With this experiment we test whether a weaker ResNet teacher is able to successfully train DenseNet-90-60 students. We use multiple configurations of Wide-ResNet teacher and train the Ban-DenseNet student with the same hyper parameters of the other DenseNet experiments.

### 4.2. Penn Tree Bank

To validate our method beyond computer vision applications, we also apply the BAN framework to language models and evaluate it on the Penn Tree Bank (PTB) dataset (Marcus et al., 1993) using the standard train/test/validation split by (Mikolov et al., 2010). We consider two BAN language models: a single layer LSTM (Hochreiter \& Schmidhuber, 1997) with 1500 units (Zaremba et al., 2014) and a smaller model from (Kim et al., 2016) combining a convolutional layers, highway layers, and a 2-layer LSTM (referred to as CNN-LSTM).

For the LSTM model we use weight tying (Press \& Wolf, 2016), $65 \%$ dropout and train for 40 epochs using SGD with a mini-batch size of 32 . An adaptive learning rate schedule is used with an initial learning rate 1 that is multiplied by a factor of 0.25 if the validation perplexity does not decrease after an epoch.

The CNN-LSTM is trained with SGD for the same number of epochs with a mini-batch size of 20 . The initial learning rate is set to 2 and is multiplied by a factor of 0.5 if the validation perplexity does not decrease by at least 0.5 after an epoch (this schedule slightly differs from (Kim et al., 2016),
but worked better for the teacher model in our experiments).
Both models are unrolled for 35 steps and the KD loss is simply applied between the softmax outputs of the unrolled teacher an student.

## 5. Results

We report the surprising finding that by performing KD across models of similar architecture, BAN student models tend to improve over their teachers across all configurations.

### 5.1. CIFAR-10

As can be observed in Table 1 the CIFAR-10 test error is systematically lower or equal for both Wide-ResNet and DenseNet student trained from an identical teacher. It is worth to note how for BAN-DenseNet the gap between architectures of different complexity is quickly reduced leading to implicit gains in the parameters to error rate ratio.

### 5.2. CIFAR-100

For CIFAR-100 we find stronger improvements for all BANDenseNet models. We focus therefore most of our experiments to explore and understand the born-again phenomena on this dataset.

BAN-DenseNet and BAN-ResNet In Table 2 we report test error rates using both labels and teacher outputs (BAN+L) or only the latter (BAN). The improvement of fully removing the label supervision is systematic across modality, it is worth noting that the smallest student BAN-DenseNet-11233 reaches an error of $16.95 \%$ with only 6.5 M parameters, comparable to the $16.87 \%$ error of the DenseNet-80-120 teacher with almost eight times more parameters.

In Table 3 all but one Wide-ResNnet student improve over their identical teacher.

Sequence of Teaching Selves Training BANs for multiple generations leads to inconsistent but positive improvements, that saturate after a few generations. The third gener-

ation of BAN-3-DenseNet-80-80 produces our single best model with 22 M parameters, achieving $15.5 \%$ error on CIFAR0100 (Table 2). To our knowledge, this is currently the SOTA non-ensemble model without shake-shake regularization. It is only beaten by Yamada et al. (2018) who use a pyramidal ResNet trained for 1800 epochs with a combination of shake-shake (Gastaldi, 2017), pyramid-drop (Yamada et al., 2016) and cut-out regularization (DeVries \& Taylor, 2017).

BAN-Ensemble Similarly, our largest ensemble BAN-3-DenseNet-BC-80-120 with 150M parameters and an error of $14.9 \%$ is the lowest reported ensemble result in the same setting. BAN-3-DenseNet-112-33 is based on the building block of the best coupled-ensemble of (Dutt et al., 2017) and reaches a single-error model of $16.59 \%$ with only 6.3 M parameters, furthermore the ensembles of two or three consecutive generations reach a comparable error of $15.77 \%$ and $15.68 \%$ with the baseline error of $15.68 \%$ reported in (Dutt et al., 2017) where four models were used.

Effect of non-argmax Logits As can be observed in the two rightmost columns if the left side of Table 2 we find that removing part of the dark knowledge still generally brings improvements to the training procedure with respect to the baseline. Importance weights CWTM lead to weak improvements over the teacher in all models but the largest DenseNet. Instead, in DKPP we find a comparable but systematic improvement effect of permuting all but the argmax dimensions.

These results demonstrate that KD does not simply contribute information on each specific non-correct output. DKPP demonstrates that the higher order moments of the output distribution that are invariant to the permutation procedure still systematically contribute to improved generalization. Furthermore, the complete removal of wrong logit information in the CWTM treatment still brings improvements for three models out of four, suggesting that the information contained in pre-trained models can be used to rebalance the training set, by giving less weight to training samples for which the teacher's output distribution is not concentrated on the max.

DenseNet to modified DenseNet students It can be seen in Table 4 that DenseNet students are particularly robust to the variations in the number of layers. The most shallow model with only half the number of its teacher layers DenseNet-7-1-2 still improves over the DenseNet-90-60 teacher with an error rate of $16.95 \%$. Deeper variations are competitive or even better than the original student. The best modified student result is $16.43 \%$ error with twice the number of layers (half the growth factor) of its DenseNet-90-60 teacher.

The biggest instabilities as well as parameter saving is obtained by modifying the compression rate of the network, indirectly reducing the dimensionality of each hidden layer. Halving the number of filters after each spatial dimension reduction in DenseNet-14-0.5-1 gives an error of $19.83 \%$, the worst across all trained DenseNets. Smaller reductions lead to larger parameter savings with lower accuracy losses, but directly choosing a smaller network retrained with BAN procedure like DenseNet-106-33 seems to lead to higher parameter efficiency.

DenseNet Teacher to ResNet Student Surprisingly, we find (Table 5) that our Wide-ResNet and Pre-ResNet students that match the output shapes at each stage of their DenseNet teachers tend to outperform classical ResNets, their teachers, and their baseline.

Both BAN-Pre-ResNet with 14 blocks per stage and BAN-Wide-ResNet with 4 blocks per stage and $50 \%$ compression factor reach respectively a test error of $17.39 \%$ and $17.13 \%$ using a parameter budget that is comparable with their teachers. We find that for BAN-Wide-ResNets, only limiting the number of blocks to 1 per stage leads to inferior performance compared to the teacher.

Similar to how adapting the depth of the models offers a nice tradeoff between memory consumption and number of sequential operations, exchanging dense and residual blocks allows to choose between concatenation and additions. By using additions, ResNets overwrite old memory banks, saving RAM, at the cost of heavier models that do not share layers offering another technical tradeoff to choose from.

ResNet Teacher to DenseNet Students The converse experiment, training a DenseNet-90-60 student from ResNet student confirms the trend of students surpassing their teachers. The improvement from ResNet to DenseNet (Table 3, right-most column) over simple label supervision is significant as indicated by $16.79 \%$ error of the DenseNet-90-60 student trained from the Wide-ResNet-28-10.

### 5.3. Penn Tree Bank

Although we did not use the state-of-the-art bag of tricks (Merity et al., 2017) for training LSTMs, nor the recently
proposed improvements on KD for sequence models (Kim \& Rush, 2016), we found significant decreases in perplexity on both validation and testing set for our benchmark language models. The smaller BAN-LSTM-CNN model decreases test perplexity from 80.05 to 76.97 , while the bigger BAN-LSTM model improves from 71.87 to 68.56 . Unlike the CNNs trained for CIFAR classification, we find that LSTM models work only when trained with a combination of teacher outputs and label loss (BAN+L). One potential explanation for this finding might be that teachers generally reach $100 \%$ accuracy on the CIFAR training sets while the PTB training perplexity is far from being minimized.

## 6. Discussion

In Marvin Minsky's Society of Mind (Minsky, 1991), the analysis of human development led to the idea of a sequence of teaching selves. Minsky suggested that sudden spurts in intelligence during childhood may be due to longer and hidden training of new "student" models under the guidance of the older self. Minsky concluded that our perception of a long-term self is constructed by an ensemble of multiple generations of internal models, which we can use for guidance when the most current model falls short. Our results show several instances where such transfer was successful in artificial neural networks.

### Description des Images

#### Première Image
L'image montre trois personnes en train de courir dans un cadre naturel. Les deux femmes et un homme sont vêtus de tenues de sport décontractées. La femme à gauche porte un t-shirt vert et un short noir, la femme à droite porte un t-shirt rose et un legging noir, et l'homme porte un t-shirt gris et un short noir. Ils semblent tous les trois être en pleine foulée, avec des expressions joyeuses et concentrées. L'arrière-plan est une forêt luxuriante avec des arbres et des buissons verts, suggérant qu'ils courent dans un parc ou une forêt.

#### Deuxième Image
Cette image représente une famille de cinq personnes posant pour une photo. Ils sont tous vêtus de chemises rouges assorties et sont assis sur le sol, les mains jointes devant eux. La famille comprend deux adultes et trois enfants. Les deux adultes sourient, et les enfants semblent également heureux et détendus. L'arrière-plan est blanc uni, ce qui met l'accent sur la famille.

#### Troisième Image
Cette image est un graphique intitulé "La Division Sociale de la France". Il compare divers indicateurs socio-économiques entre les zones défavorisées et la France dans son ensemble. Les indicateurs incluent :
- **Part des personnes faisant partie de la classe ouvrière** : 33,5 % dans les zones défavorisées contre 14,5 % dans toute la France.
- **Taux de chômage** : 18,1 % dans les zones défavorisées contre 7,3 % dans toute la France.
- **Pourcentage de jeunes de 16-25 ans non scolarisés et sans emploi** : 25,2 % dans les zones défavorisées contre 12,9 % dans toute la France.
- **Revenu mensuel médian** : 1 168 € dans les zones défavorisées contre 1 822 € dans toute la France.
- **Taux de pauvreté** : 43,3 % dans les zones défavorisées contre 15,5 % dans toute la France.
- **Pourcentage de ménages vivant dans des logements surpeuplés** : 22,0 % dans les zones défavorisées contre 8,7 % dans toute la France.

Le graphique utilise des barres rouges pour les zones défavorisées et des barres bleues pour la France dans son ensemble, offrant une comparaison visuelle claire des disparités socio-économiques.

A great question about a classic condiment!

Dijon mayonnaise, also known as Dijon dressing or Dijon sauce, is a type of mayonnaise that originated from the Dijon region in France. The ingredients that make up traditional Dijon mayonnaise are:

1. **Egg yolks**: Similar to regular mayonnaise, Dijon mayonnaise is made with egg yolks, which provide richness and creaminess.
2. **Oil**: A neutral-tasting oil, such as canola or grapeseed oil, is used to create the emulsion.
3. **White wine vinegar** (or **white wine**: Traditionally, Dijon mayonnaise is made with white wine vinegar, which adds a tangy flavor and a hint of acidity. However, some recipes may use white wine as a substitute.
4. **Mustard**: This is the key ingredient that gives Dijon mayonnaise its characteristic flavor and color. There are two types of mustard used:
	* **Whole-grain mustard**: This type of mustard is made with mustard seeds, which are ground into a coarse paste. The whole grains add a slightly coarser texture and a more pronounced mustard flavor.
	* **White mustard**: This is a finer, more refined type of mustard that's often used in Dijon mayonnaise. It has a milder flavor than whole-grain mustard.
5. **Seasonings**: Salt and any additional flavorings, such as onion powder or garlic powder, may be added to enhance the taste.
6. **Water**: Some recipes may include a small amount of water to thin out the mayonnaise to the desired consistency.

The ratio of ingredients can vary depending on the recipe or brand, but here's a rough estimate of the proportions:

* Egg yolks: 1/3 to 1/2 of the total ingredients
* Oil: 1/3 to 1/2 of the total ingredients
* Mustard: 1-2 tablespoons
* Vinegar (or wine): 1-2 tablespoons
* Salt and seasonings: a pinch
* Water: 1-2 tablespoons (optional)

Keep in mind that some commercial Dijon mayonnaise brands may have different ingredient lists, so feel free to experiment with your own recipe or try a store-bought version to find the one that suits your taste buds the best!

A classic condiment! Dijon mayonnaise, also known as Dijon-style mayonnaise, is a variation of traditional mayonnaise with a distinct flavor profile. The ingredients that make up Dijon mayonnaise typically include:

**Essential ingredients:**

1. **Mayonnaise base**: This is the basic mixture of oil, egg yolks, and vinegar or lemon juice, which provides the foundation for the condiment.
2. **Mustard**: Dijon mustard is the key ingredient that gives Dijon mayonnaise its characteristic flavor. The type of mustard used can vary, but a Dijon-style mustard (e.g., made with white wine and spices) is commonly used.
3. **Salt**: A small amount of salt enhances the flavor and helps to balance the other ingredients.

**Optional ingredients:**

1. **White wine**: Some recipes may include a small amount of white wine vinegar or wine to enhance the flavor.
2. **Sugar**: A tiny amount of sugar may be added to balance the flavor, especially if the mustard used is quite strong.
3. **Flavorings**: Depending on the recipe, additional flavorings like garlic, onion, or other spices may be added to create a unique twist.

**Traditional Dijon mayonnaise recipe:**

To make a basic Dijon mayonnaise, you can combine:

* 1 egg yolk
* 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
* 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar or lemon juice
* 1/2 cup neutral-tasting oil, such as canola or grapeseed oil
* Salt (to taste)

Mix the ingredients together and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

/*
 Dijon mayonnaise is a type of mayonnaise that incorporates Dijon mustard, a coarse-grained mustard originating from the town of Dijon, France. Here's a simple recipe for homemade Dijon mayo:

- 1 large egg yolk (pasteurized if available) or 2 small egg yolks
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- Salt, to taste
- White wine vinegar or cider vinegar, about 1 teaspoon
- Ground black pepper, optional
- 1 cup canola oil or other neutral oil (grapeseed oil works well too)
- 1/2 - 3/4 cup vegetable oil

Instructions:

1. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolk(s), Dijon mustard, salt, vinegar, and pepper if using. The mixture should be smooth with no lumps.

2. Slowly drizzle in the canola oil while continuously whisking (or use an immersion blender) to create an emulsion. Be sure to add the oil drop by drop at first, then gradually increase the flow as the mayonnaise thickens.

3. Once the mixture starts to thicken and emulsify, you can continue adding the oil in a thin stream. The mayonnaise should be thick and creamy. If it's too thick, you can adjust by thinning with a bit more vinegar or water.

4. Taste and adjust seasoning as necessary. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

Enjoy your homemade Dijon mayonnaise!

/*
 Dijon Mayonnaise is a type of mayonnaise that traditionally originates from the Dijon region in France. The basic ingredients for making Dijon mayonnaise include:

1. Egg yolks - These provide the emulsion base for the mayonnaise.

2. Oil - A neutral-tasting oil such as canola or vegetable oil is commonly used.

3. Vinegar (or lemon juice) - This adds acidity to balance the richness of the mayonnaise. Traditional Dijon mustard contains white wine vinegar, which gives it a tangy flavor. You can use white wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar or even freshly squeezed lemon juice if you prefer a lemon-flavored mayonnaise.

4. Dijon mustard - This is what sets Dijon mayonnaise apart from regular mayonnaise. It provides a distinct flavor that complements various dishes.

5. Salt and pepper - To taste, these season the mayonnaise.

6. Water (optional) - Adding a small amount of water can help thin out the mixture if it becomes too thick during preparation.

Okay, let's break down each media step-by-step.

**Media 1: Three People Running in a Park**

**Description:** This is a color photograph depicting three individuals jogging along a dirt path in a lush, green park. The perspective is level with the runners, giving the viewer a sense of participating in the activity.
*   **People:**
    *   A man on the left, appears to be in his late 30s to early 40s, with short, dark hair and a well-built physique. He is wearing a grey, long-sleeved athletic shirt and black shorts. He is smiling and his posture suggests he's comfortable with the run.
    *   A young woman in the middle likely is in her late teens or early 20s, is wearing a bright yellow athletic top and black running shorts. Her hair is loose and blowing in the breeze. She has a youthful, energetic expression and is smiling.
    *   A woman on the right, seems to be in her 30s or 40s, is wearing a pink long-sleeved shirt and black leggings. She is smiling and appears to be enjoying the run. She has her hair pulled back.
*   **Setting:** The background consists of dense green vegetation – trees and shrubs – creating a natural, park-like atmosphere. The light is bright, suggesting a sunny day. There's a clear path extending into the distance, suggesting a longer run is possible.
*   **Overall Feeling:** This image conveys a sense of health, fitness, camaraderie, and enjoyment of nature. It has a positive and uplifting vibe.

**Media 2: Family Portrait**

**Description:** This is a color photograph featuring a family of five posed on a white background.
*   **People:**
    *   Two women – likely a mother and a daughter - are present, wearing matching red long-sleeved shirts. The woman on the left has long, flowing brown hair and a warm smile. The woman on the right has blonde hair and a similar expression.
    *   Two young boys, presumably their sons or brothers, are positioned in between the two women. They also wear matching red long-sleeved shirts. Each boy has a joyful expression
    *   A man appears to be the father, sits in the center is looking directly at the camera, with a big smile. He is also wearing a matching red shirt.
*   **Background:** The background is a clean, white surface. This minimalistic background focuses the viewer's attention solely on the family members.
*   **Pose:** Everyone is laying with their forearms and hands resting on the ground, close together.
*   **Overall Feeling**: The image portrays a cohesive and happy family unit. It likely was taken as a formal portrait or for a special occasion.

**Media 3: Infographic - France's Social Divide**

**Description**: This is a color infographic presented by Statista that compares socioeconomic indicators between disadvantaged areas and the whole of France.

*   **Title**: "France's Social Divide"
*   **Overall Design**: The infographic utilizes a bar chart format to visually represent the comparison. Each bar shows the percentage or value of a specific indicator, with different colors representing disadvantaged areas (“Red”) and all of France ("Blue").
*   **Indicators Shown**: The infographic presents data for the following indicators:
    *   Percentage of working-class members
    *   Unemployment rate
    *   Percentage of 16-25 year olds not in school or employed
    *   Median monthly income (in Euros)
    *   Poverty rate
    *   Percentage of households in overcrowded housing.
*   **Annotation**: There’s a footnote clarifying the definition of “disadvantaged areas” and providing data sources and dates.
*   **Purpose:** The infographic is designed to clearly illustrate the disparities between disadvantaged areas and the rest of France, highlighting economic and social challenges.

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

/*
Dijon mayonnaise is a flavorful twist on traditional mayonnaise, incorporating Dijon mustard for a tangy, sharp kick. While recipes can vary, the core ingredients typically include:

1. **Mayonnaise** - The base of the mixture, providing the creamy texture. This can be store-bought or homemade (made from egg yolks, oil, vinegar or lemon juice, and salt).
2. **Dijon Mustard** - The star ingredient, a French-style mustard made from brown or black mustard seeds, white wine, vinegar, and salt. It adds a spicy, tangy depth.
3. **Lemon Juice** (optional) - Often added for a touch of brightness and acidity to balance the richness.
4. **Salt and Pepper** (optional) - To taste, enhancing the overall flavor.
5. **Garlic** (optional) - Sometimes included, either minced or as garlic powder, for an extra layer of savory flavor.
6. **Herbs or Spices** (optional) - Some variations might include a pinch of cayenne, paprika, or fresh herbs like tarragon for complexity.

**Typical Preparation**: Simply mix the mayonnaise with Dijon mustard (usually in a ratio of about 4:1 or to taste) and adjust with the optional ingredients as desired. It’s often used as a spread for sandwiches, a dip, or a base for dressings.

If you’re looking for a specific brand or recipe, let me know, and I can try to dig deeper into the galactic pantry for you! What do you plan to use it for?

Dijon mayonnaise is a flavored mayonnaise that incorporates Dijon mustard, which gives it a tangy and slightly spicy flavor. The exact ingredients can vary depending on the brand or recipe, but the core components typically include:

1. **Mayonnaise Base**:
   - **Egg yolks** (or whole eggs, depending on the recipe)
   - **Oil** (usually a neutral oil like vegetable oil, canola oil, or sometimes olive oil)
   - **Vinegar** or **lemon juice** (for acidity and to help emulsify the mixture)
   - **Salt** (for seasoning)

2. **Dijon Mustard**:
   - Made from brown or black mustard seeds, white wine (or a mix of vinegar and water), salt, and sometimes other seasonings. Dijon mustard adds the signature sharp, tangy flavor to the mayonnaise.

3. **Additional Seasonings** (optional, depending on the recipe or brand):
   - **Pepper** (often white or black pepper for a subtle kick)
   - **Sugar** or **honey** (to balance the acidity and sharpness, in small amounts)
   - **Herbs** or **spices** (some recipes might include garlic, tarragon, or other flavorings)

If you're making Dijon mayonnaise at home, you can simply mix store-bought or homemade mayonnaise with a generous amount of Dijon mustard to taste. For store-bought versions, check the label for specific ingredients, as some may include preservatives or stabilizers like xanthan gum..

The scene is lit with soft, natural sunlight filtering through the leaves, enhancing the realistic and calm atmosphere without any distracting elements.

 * The image shows three people jogging together along a green, nature-filled path. They appear to be enjoying a workout in a lush outdoor setting with trees and vegetation surrounding the trail. The runners are wearing athletic clothing - one in a gray shirt with black shorts, another in a bright yellow tank top with black shorts, and the third in a pink top with black leggings. They seem to be running at a comfortable pace, and the scene conveys a sense of health, fitness, and outdoor activity. The natural environment looks bright and vibrant, making it an appealing setting for outdoor exercise.

### **Why This Works**
- **Protein** (eggs, yogurt, tofu) keeps you full and supports muscle health.
- **Fiber** (oats, whole grains, fruits) aids digestion and stabilizes blood sugar.
- **Healthy fats** (avocado, nuts) promote brain function and satiety.
- **Seasonal fruits** add antioxidants and natural sweetness.
