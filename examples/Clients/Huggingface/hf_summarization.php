During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first structure to reach a height of 300 metres.

Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.";
