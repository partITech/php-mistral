## Managing Messages in PhpMistral

This documentation explains how to use the `Messages` and `Message` objects in the **PhpMistral** library, which simplifies interactions with various generative AI services such as **Mistral**, **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, **vLLM**, **Llama.cpp**, and others. It provides best practices, the rationale behind certain coding conventions, and guidance on how to structure effective multi-turn conversations.

## Why Use `Messages` and `Message` Objects?

Modern generative AI services typically require **conversation context** in the form of a list of structured messages. This list contains exchanges between different roles such as:
- `system`: defines behavior or general instructions for the model,
- `user`: represents messages sent by the user,
- `assistant`: responses from the AI,
- `tool`: integration with tools or intermediate results.

Each provider (Mistral, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) has **slight variations in the expected format** for these messages. The `Messages` and `Message` objects in **PhpMistral** encapsulate this formatting logic, providing a unified experience across different backends.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `Messages` and `Message` objects ensure **automatic compatibility with the selected service**, preventing formatting errors during API calls.

## Best Practices for Creating Conversations

### Recommended Approach

The best way to structure a conversation is to use the **methods provided by the client** (`MistralClient`, `OpenAIClient`, etc.), which automatically configure the message type:

```php
$client   = new MistralClient($apiKey);
$messages = $client->getMessages()
                   ->addSystemMessage('You are a gentle bot who respond like a pirate')
                   ->addUserMessage('What is the best French cheese?');

try {
    $result = $client->chat(
        $messages,
        [
            'model' => 'mistral-3b-latest',
            'temperature' => 0.7,
            'top_p' => 1,
            'max_tokens' => 250,
            'safe_prompt' => false,
            'random_seed' => null
        ]
    );
} catch (\Throwable $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
    exit(1);
}
```

> [!TIP]
> This approach ensures that the **service type** (Mistral, OpenAI, etc.) is properly accounted for during message creation, guaranteeing the correct format.

---

### Discouraged Approach

Creating `Messages` objects **without specifying the client type** might work but **breaks encapsulation** and risks omitting service-specific requirements:

```php
$client = new MistralClient($apiKey);
$messages = new Messages(); // Discouraged: no type specified!
$messages->addUserMessage('What is the best French cheese?');
```

> [!CAUTION]
> This method does not define the `type` (Mistral, OpenAI, etc.), which may lead to **format errors** when sending requests to the service.

---

### Valid Alternative (More Verbose)

For advanced use cases where **greater control** over each `Message` is needed:

```php
$client   = new MistralClient($apiKey);
$messages = new Messages(type: Client::TYPE_MISTRAL);

$message = new Message(type: Client::TYPE_MISTRAL);
$message->setRole(Messages::ROLE_SYSTEM);
$message->setContent('You are a gentle bot. Respond like a pirate');
$messages->addMessage($message);

$message = new Message(type: Client::TYPE_MISTRAL);
$message->setRole(Messages::ROLE_USER);
$message->setContent('What is the best French cheese?');
$messages->addMessage($message);
```

This approach provides **full control** over individual messages but is **more verbose and complex**.

## Internal Mechanics of `Messages` and `Message`

### Service Type (`type`)

The `type` attribute is crucial for adapting the **message structure** to the target service:

| Client Type           | PHP Constant            |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Mistral               | `Client::TYPE_MISTRAL`  |
| OpenAI                | `Client::TYPE_OPENAI`   |
| Anthropic             | `Client::TYPE_ANTHROPIC`|
| X.AI                  | `Client::TYPE_XAI`      |
| Llama.cpp             | `Client::TYPE_LLAMACPP` |
| vLLM                  | `Client::TYPE_VLLM`     |

Each provider has **specific requirements** (e.g., `tool_calls` for OpenAI or image formatting for Anthropic), and the `type` ensures **automatic adjustment** of the message format.

---

## Advanced Message Manipulation

You can directly access the underlying `ArrayObject` containing the messages for custom operations:

```php
$messages = $client->getMessages();
$arrayMessages = $messages->getMessages(); // ArrayObject

foreach ($arrayMessages as $message) {
    // Manipulate individual messages
}
```

---

## Why Prefer Client-Based Message Creation?

1. **Full encapsulation**: the client manages the message format and type automatically.
2. **Guaranteed compatibility**: the message structure always aligns with the target service (Mistral, OpenAI, etc.).
3. **Error reduction**: no risk of sending malformed messages that might be rejected by the API.
4. **Simplified maintenance**: if the API format changes, the library can adapt without requiring code changes on your end.

> [!WARNING]
> Avoid creating `Messages` or `Message` objects **without specifying a type**, as this can cause compatibility issues with certain services.

---

## Special Cases: Multimodality and Tool Integration

The message system also supports **multimodal content** (images, audio, documents) and **tool integration** (tool calls).

### Example: Adding an Image

```php
$message = $client->newMessage();
$message->setRole(Messages::ROLE_USER);
$message->addContent(Message::MESSAGE_TYPE_IMAGE_URL, 'https://example.com/image.jpg');
```

### Example: Adding a Tool Result

```php
$messages->addToolMessage(
    name: 'weather',
    content: ['temperature' => '22Â°C'],
    toolCallId: 'abc-123'
);
```

> [!NOTE]
> These features are **automatically adapted** to the client type (e.g., documents are formatted differently for **Anthropic**).

## Conclusion

Using the `Messages` and `Message` objects **via the client** is the safest and most efficient way to build conversations tailored to different AI providers. This approach ensures compatibility, reduces errors, and simplifies maintenance.
