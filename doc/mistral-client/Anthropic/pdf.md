## Pdf
Process PDFs with Claude. Extract text, analyze charts, and understand visual content from your documents.

You can now ask Claude about any text, pictures, charts, and tables in PDFs you provide. Some sample use cases:

- Analyzing financial reports and understanding charts/tables
- Extracting key information from legal documents
- Translation assistance for documents
- Converting document information into structured formats

### Check PDF requirements

Claude works with any standard PDF. However, you should ensure your request size meets these requirements when using PDF support:

| Requirement              | Limit                          |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Maximum request size     | 32MB                           |
| Maximum pages per request| 100                            |
| Format                   | Standard PDF (no passwords/encryption) |

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that both limits are on the entire request payload, including any other content sent alongside PDFs.

Since PDF support relies on Claudeâ€™s vision capabilities, it is subject to the same limitations and considerations as other vision tasks.
